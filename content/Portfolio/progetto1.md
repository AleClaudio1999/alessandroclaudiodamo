## Abstract

This work presents the experimental replication of selected studies described in the paper *“Interference-Free Operating System: A 6 Years’ Experience in Mitigating Cross-Core Interference in Linux”* (RTSS 2024), with the goal of assessing their validity across different hardware platforms and operating systems. In particular, the core isolation mechanisms listed in Table III of the paper were systematically applied on three kernels: kernel: Linux "Vanilla" 5.10, LinuxRT 5.10 and Openeuler 22.03 (based on Linux 5.10) , while carefully documenting procedures, challenges, and practical limitations. Subsequently, experiments were conducted to measure maximum latency (*cyclictest*), latency distribution (*cyclictest* and *oslat*), task-set schedulability and communication latency in ROS 2. The results show that openEuler, while not completely eliminating cross-core interference, achieves lower latencies and more stable performance compared to Linux "Vanilla", and results better but more similar to the RT kernel. The analysis further highlights that, despite the intrinsic limitations of Linux, the adoption of appropriate isolation mechanisms and specific kernel patches can significantly mitigate the impact of interference. The contribution of this work lies not only in the empirical confirmation of the paper’s claims, but also in providing a practical guide for researchers and developers interested in replicating or extending these experiments.



## Section 1 - Introduction

In this introductory chapter, we present the objectives of our work, outlining both the rationale behind the study and the specific goals that guide the following experimental analysis.

### 1.1 Context of the Paper

With the advent of multicore systems, real-time applications have benefited from increased computational power and, at least in theory, from the ability to meet tighter timing constraints.
However, this led to a phenomenon that must be taken into account, namely *core interference*: 

**Core interference** is the phenomenon that occurs between different cores of a multicore processor when they share common hardware resources.
Such sharing can cause the activities executed on one core to introduce **delays, jitter, or performance degradation** on other cores, even if those cores are dedicated to independent or real-time tasks. 
Indeed, this phenomenon prevents Linux from fully isolating cores dedicated to real-time (RT) tasks from other system activities: even when cores are supposedly isolated, they may still experience interference that leads to jitter and delays on the isolated real-time tasks. In the following section, we will examine examples of the types of interference events that generate jitter and delays on isolated cores in Linux.

Through the contributions presented by the authors of the paper under review *(“Interference-free Operating System: A 6 Years’ Experience in Mitigating Cross-Core Interference in Linux”*) , this phenomenon was effectively mitigated, resulting in a substantial improvement compared to the system’s behavior prior to these modifications.

### 1.2 Objectives of This Work

The objectives of this work are fourfold:

1. To thoroughly understand the paper and identify the theoretical causes of cross-core interference, as well as the modifications proposed by the authors to mitigate the problem.
2. To investigate and demonstrate how to apply the proposed isolation mechanisms in order to obtain cores truly dedicated to real-time tasks (as described in Table III of the paper).
3. To replicate and illustrate the replication of some of the key experiments presented in the paper—particularly those in Sections V-B and V-C—using different hardware and operating systems, with the aim of empirically validating the claims of the original work.
4. To demonstrate the conclusions of the paper: specifically, to assess whether Linux, due to cross-core interference, can introduce temporal interference, to what extent such interference can cause execution delays and timing variability, and to evaluate how effectively the authors’ work with OpenEuler can mitigate this phenomenon

### 1.3 Scope

In this work, we did not replicate all the experiments and the complete theoretical framework presented in the paper; instead, we will focus on:

- **Addressed**: isolation techniques, measurements with `cyclictest/oslat`, schedulability with fixed priority, measurements with ROS2.
- **Not addressed**: industrial evaluations with CFS, complex schedulability analyses.

### 1.4 Achieved contributions

- **Systematic application and procedural description of isolation mechanisms** outlined in Table III of the *Interference-Free Operating System* paper, implemented on "Vanilla" Linux, Linux RT and openEuler.
- **Experimental replication** of several key experiments from the paper (latency with *cyclictest* and *oslat*, latency distribution, task-set schedulability, ROS2 communication tests), conducted on hardware different from that of the original authors. This serves to experimentally validate the effectiveness of the proposed modifications across diverse hardware through a critical comparison of our results with those reported in the paper.
- **Documented experience**: a collection of procedures, commands, observations, and encountered challenges in applying the isolation mechanisms, providing a practical reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to reproduce or extend this work.

### 1.5 Experimental Setup

In this paragraph, we introduce the environment in which some of the paper’s experiments were replicated:

- **Hardware**: Intel i7-3770, 4 physical cores (8 logical).
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu 22.04 with RT kernel 5.10, openEuler 22.03 (with kernel Openeuler base on "vanilla" Linux 5.10), Ubuntu with Vanilla Linux 5.10.
- **Tools**: `perf`, `stress-ng`, `cyclictest`, `oslat`, `rt-tests`, `ROS2`.



## Section 2 – Background and Related Work: Understanding the Paper

This chapter provides a summary of the key concepts presented in the paper, together with the theoretical background required to understand the subsequent experiments and the paper’s objectives.

### 2.1 **Cross-Core Interference**

*Cross-core interference* occurs when execution on one core introduces variable delays in the execution of another core, without direct interaction, thereby undermining **temporal predictability** in real-time systems.

According to the paper, this phenomenon can compromise the operating system’s ability to isolate **real-time (RT) tasks.** By *OS-level isolation* we refer to the mechanisms already provided in Linux to dedicate certain cores exclusively to RT activities (e.g., `isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, `irqaffinity`, etc.).

In practice, this means that even cores reserved for real-time may still experience disturbances from other processors in the system, resulting in delayed task **activations**, unintended **preemption** of high-priority tasks, and increased blocking times for RT activities. 

These issues arise from the activation of system threads or non-essential tasks on the isolated cores, thereby interrupting the execution of high-priority tasks. Specific examples of these cases will be presented in Section 2.5.



### 2.2 Main Contributions of the Paper

- Highlighting that **the OS itself is a primary source of temporal interference**.
- Sharing industrial experience in identifying and fixing cross-core interference bugs in Linux.
- Extracting **general mitigation principles** and lessons for future research.
- Evaluating improvements through **schedulability analysis** and **real-world case studies**.



### 2.3 Demonstrating the Existence of Cross-Core Interference

The paper aims to demonstrate that the current Linux kernel can be a source of temporal interference (i.e., introduce unpredictable delays) and that the isolation mechanisms provided by the OS are insufficient.

To show this, the authors partitioned their multicore processor into two groups:

- **Pr** = cores dedicated to *real-time*.
- **Pn** = cores for non-RT workloads.

They enabled all available isolation mechanisms (as listed in Table 3).

Their assumptions were:

- Tasks on **Pr** meet their RT constraints.
- **Pn** does not communicate with **Pr**.
- **Pn** may be arbitrarily overloaded.

Despite these conditions, the authors observed interference events and increased latencies using *ftrace*, concluding that even when all isolation mechanisms are applied, Linux itself introduces extra activity on isolated cores. The subsequent experiments quantify this interference and evaluate how far their patches improve the situation.

### 2.4 Core Isolation Mechanisms

Another, more implicit, contribution of the paper is its detailed explanation of the core-isolation mechanisms currently available in Linux. These mechanisms were applied in both the paper’s experiments and in our own replications. 
Among the mechanisms not covered in this chapter but discussed in the paper are those related to NUMA, since they are not present in my system and are therefore not relevant for analysis in this work.

1. **Kernel Compilation Options**
   The kernel must be compiled with options that minimize kernel interruptions and background activity on cores reserved for RT tasks.
2. **Kernel Boot Parameters**
   In the GRUB configuration, the following parameters are used:
   - **`isolcpus= Pr_cores_list`** which removes cores from the general scheduler.
   - **`nohz_full= Pr_core_list`** which eliminates periodic scheduling ticks.
   - **`rcu_nocbs= Pr_core_list`** which offloads RCU callbacks to system cores.
   - **`irqaffinity= Pn_core_list`** which ensures interrupts are handled only by system cores.
   - **`pcie_aspm=off`** which disables PCIe power-saving features that can introduce latency.
3. **Disable irqbalance**
   `irqbalance` is a daemon that automatically distributes IRQs across CPUs. Disabling it ensures IRQs remain confined to manually assigned system cores.
4. **IRQ Affinity on System Cores**
   Explicitly binding hardware interrupts (IRQs) to system cores is essential to prevent disturbances on isolated cores.
5. **Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP)**
   THP aggregates 4KB pages into 2MB pages. Allocation and splitting of huge pages occurs asynchronously and unpredictably, and must be disabled in RT or interference-free systems.
6. **Disable `memory.move_charge_at_immigrate` (cgroups v1)**
   This kernel feature migrates memory pages when a task moves between cgroups. It introduces non-deterministic memory movement and must be disabled.
7. **Disable Kernel Same-page Merging (KSM)**
   KSM merges identical memory pages used by multiple processes (e.g., in VMs/containers). Its background memory scanning introduces unpredictable delays and must be turned off.
8. **Move `kswapd` to System Cores**
   `kswapd` is the kernel thread handling swapping and page reclaim. It must be pinned to system cores to prevent disturbances on RT cores.
9. **Restrict `pcrypt` to System Cores**
   The `pcrypt` module performs parallel cryptographic operations (AES, SHA, etc.) used in IPsec, dm-crypt, etc. When enabled, it may schedule parallel tasks across multiple cores, and must be restricted to system cores.
10. **Restrict Workqueue `cpumask` to System Cores**
    Many asynchronous kernel activities are handled through workqueues executed by `kworker` threads. By default, they can run on any core, including isolated ones, introducing interference. Their execution must be restricted to system cores.
11. **Disable Timer Migration**
    Timer migration allows the kernel to move active timers across cores for load balancing and energy efficiency. It must be disabled to prevent timers from firing on isolated cores, as this introduces unpredictable interference.
12. **RCU Non-Preemptible (rcu_normal=1)**
    RCU (Read-Copy-Update) uses asynchronous callbacks, which in *preemptible* mode can interrupt RT tasks. Enabling non-preemptible RCU enforces a more predictable, classic RCU mode, reducing jitter.
13. **Disable RT Runtime/Period Limits**
    By default, Linux enforces CPU runtime limits for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR tasks (95% of CPU time). This safeguard is unnecessary in interference-free setups, where cores are fully dedicated to RT tasks, and must be disabled.
14. **Disable Swap**
    Kernel swap activity is inherently non-deterministic and unacceptable in RT or interference-free systems. Swap must be completely disabled



### 2.5 Experience in Mitigating Cross-Core Interference

This paper also summarizes six years of Linux bug fixing and patching aimed at minimizing cross-core interference (34 bugs fixed with 40 patches). The authors classified and described the main bugs and their resolutions.

#### Scheduling and Task Placement Bugs

**a) Workqueue management bug**

- **Context:** A workqueue is a kernel mechanism similar to a queue that holds asynchronous tasks. Worker threads dequeue and execute these tasks.
- **Problem:** In some cases, Linux wakes worker threads on *all* cores, including isolated ones dedicated to real-time. This is done via an IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt), forcing the isolated core to handle the interrupt, perform a context switch, execute the worker task, and then return to the RT task—introducing jitter and interference.
- **Solution:** A worker thread should only be awakened if there are pending items in its workqueue. Moreover, non-isolated cores must never wake isolated cores, thus avoiding unnecessary disturbances.

**b) Incoherent task migration bug**

- **Context:** Migration allows a task or thread to be moved from one core to another, triggered by either the OS or the user.
- **Problem:** Migration can disregard isolation constraints. A task may be erroneously placed on an isolated core; if it spawns child threads, the kernel may move the main thread but leave the children behind, breaking isolation.
- **Solution:** Migration must be **coherent for the entire thread group**: when the main thread is moved, all its children must be moved together to preserve isolation.

#### Resource Management and Sharing Bugs

**a) ASID isolation bug across cores**

- **Context:** The TLB caches virtual-to-physical address translations. Without identifiers, each process needs exclusive use of the TLB, requiring flushes on every context switch. With **ASIDs (Address Space Identifiers)**, multiple processes can coexist in the TLB, avoiding unnecessary flushes.
- **Problem:** ASIDs are limited and shared across all cores. If non-isolated cores consume all identifiers, RT processes on isolated cores are forced to perform extra flushes due to non-RT activity.
- **Solution:** Partition the ASID space between isolated and non-isolated cores, reserving a quota exclusively for RT processes.

**b) Device queue flush bug**

- **Context:** Devices such as NICs maintain per-core queues for incoming packets. When a device is removed, Linux flushes *all* queues, including those on isolated cores that never received traffic.
- **Problem:** This introduces disturbances on isolated cores, triggered by non-RT activity.
- **Solution:** Flush only if there are pending packets, and generate a warning if a flush is triggered by a non-isolated core.

#### Concurrency and Coordination Bugs

**a) Locking bug on `jiffies`**

- **Context:** `jiffies` is a global variable counting system timer ticks. Concurrent access requires synchronization (e.g., seqlock, spinlock).
- **Problem:** If an isolated core attempts to read `jiffies` while others are writing, it may spin in a retry loop, making its behavior dependent on non-isolated activity and breaking isolation.
- **Solution:** Minimize critical-section duration, remove unnecessary operations, and eliminate redundant locks to reduce impact on isolated cores.

**b) Distributed coordination bug (system statistics)**

- **Context:** Linux periodically collects global statistics (memory, disk, etc.). The `vmstat_shepherd` function activates work on all cores to update counters.
- **Problem:** Isolated cores are unnecessarily disturbed to update statistics irrelevant to RT tasks.
- **Solution:** Restrict statistics updates to the relevant partition only, and ensure the initiating core belongs to the same partition, avoiding interference on isolated cores.



### 2.6 Lessons Learned

Despite the improvements made, the authors explicitly acknowledge that their work remains insufficient and will likely never be fully adequate.

The main reason is that Linux lacks a well-designed mechanism to enforce true isolation across cores. This is because the operating system is extremely complex and fragmented, composed of many independent subsystems, making it difficult to identify and control sources of interference.

Linux is not a simple monolithic system: it consists of dozens of independent subsystems, each with its own logic, priorities, and behaviors, often designed without considering interference with other components.

This makes it difficult to predict the impact of a modification or workload on other parts of the system, as interactions between subsystems can produce nonlinear and unpredictable behaviors.

This also applies to existing isolation mechanisms (e.g., `isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, `irqaffinity`), which are not integrated into a single coherent strategy. They are independent and managed separately, without a unified view of isolation. This fragmentation makes it challenging to guarantee effective and consistent isolation across cores.

As a result, an engineer must manually combine different configurations, without being able to rely on a single rule that ensures complete isolation.

This fragmented structure requires locks and synchronization mechanisms to ensure coherence among subsystems when accessing shared resources, inevitably causing interference and making it impossible to guarantee full isolation without rethinking both the software and the hardware architecture.

Moreover, there is an absence of well-defined boundaries between isolated and non-isolated resources: CPUs, caches, memory buses, and I/O devices are often shared among processes and cores without clear separation. This involuntary sharing inevitably generates temporal interference, such as unpredictable delays, variable latency, or sudden spikes in usage.

Even when a core is “isolated” at the software level, shared hardware can introduce interference that the operating system cannot control.

These issues are exacerbated by the lack of a solid theoretical foundation and limited academic involvement, which hinder the development of effective and validated solutions for core isolation.

Academic involvement in developing isolation solutions for Linux has so far been limited. Most studies focus on real-time systems or experimental microkernels, leaving few systematic contributions for the general-purpose Linux kernel. Consequently, the available isolation techniques are often developed empirically, without theoretical models to guarantee their correctness or predictability. This lack of formal foundations makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of solutions in different scenarios and on heterogeneous hardware. Furthermore, the absence of standardized metrics prevents rigorous comparisons between existing isolation strategies.

Overall, the insufficient academic support limits the generalizability and robustness of proposed solutions, intensifying the challenges of controlling core interference: without a deep understanding and systematic approach, it is difficult to fully and reliably address inter-core interference.



## Section 3 - **Experimental Methodology** and Results

In this chapter, we present the execution of the various experiments and the results we obtained. The implementation details of all experiments are described in Section 7

### 3.1 Introduction

The experiments presented in this chapter are conducted on a system already **isolated** as described in **Table 3**, and in many cases with **interference** generated by the system cores, as detailed in each paragraph following the **methodology** of the paper (which, in turn, is grounded in the theoretical framework summarized in Chapter 2).

As in the original paper, the experiments were carried out on the following **kernels**:

- RT kernel 5.10
- openEuler 22.03 (based on Vanilla 5.10)
- Vanilla Linux 5.10

The choice of these slightly older kernels is motivated by the fact that many of the authors’ modifications have since been **merged upstream** into the Linux source code. Consequently, the more recent versions of the kernel already include all the changes introduced by openEuler. By relying on these older versions, not only do we work with kernels that are comparable, but we can also perform a complete and rigorous evaluation of the modifications.

**Implementation** details are discussed in chapter 7.

### 3.2 Interference events on isolated cores measured with Ftrace

We have seen in Section 2.5 examples of interference events, namely undesired activities that occur on an isolated core despite the kernel’s isolation mechanisms. As shown in Section 2.1, such events may delay the activation of tasks due to the additional latency introduced by interference, erroneously preempt high-priority tasks, increase the blocking time of real-time activities, and worsen the schedulability of tasks.
The reference paper classifies such events into three main categories:

- **IPI handling**: inter-processor interrupts that, if received on an isolated core, introduce unwanted disturbance.
- **Context switch**: undesired context switches caused by workqueues, migrations, or global locks.
- **TLB flush**: invalidations of the TLB cache that result in performance degradation and increased latency.

In this section, we aim to quantify the number of cross-core interference events that occur on the three different systems, and to evaluate how effective the modifications introduced by the authors of the reference paper have proven to be. To this end, unlike in the original paper, I also replicated the measurements on Vanilla Linux and Linux RT.

Using **Ftrace**, I performed a 10-second analysis and event count on a single **isolated** core; meanwhile the remaining cores were heavily loaded with programs generating interference (thread creation, memory allocations, network operations, and memory stress).

#### Table I – Number of interference events recorded on isolated cores in OpenEuler, Vanilla Linux, and Linux RT

This table rappresent the number of interference events recorded on isolated cores (10-second ftrace trace; non-isolated cores under stress). Lower values indicate fewer cross-core interference events.

|                | Open euler | Vanilla | Linux RT |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| Context Switch | 21         | 32      | 26       |
| IPI            | 6          | 198     | 14       |
| TLB flush      | 0          | 0       | 0        |

The data clearly show that **OpenEuler significantly reduces interference events** compared to Vanilla Linux and Linux RT.

- **IPI** are almost absent in OpenEuler (6 events), whereas in Vanilla Linux they reach very high values (198), highlighting that core isolation is much more effective in OpenEuler.
- **Undesired context switches** are also fewer in OpenEuler (21) than in Vanilla Linux (32) and slightly better than in Linux RT (26), confirming that scheduling and workqueue management on isolated cores are more stable.
- **TLB flushes** are instead absent in all cases.

In summary, the experiment demonstrates that **OpenEuler ensures more effective core isolation**, reducing interference events and unwanted interruptions caused by context switches and IPIs.

### 3.3 Measuring the maximum latency of a real-time task under interference

The **maximum latency** of a real-time task represents the worst response time recorded between the activation of the thread and its actual wake-up. It is a crucial parameter for real-time systems, because if the maximum latency exceeds the safety margin of the deadline, the task fails. Furthermore, it provides a stronger guarantee of schedulability, since a lower maximum latency allows a larger number of real-time tasks to meet their deadlines.

In this section, we aim to quantify the impact of cross-core interference events on maximum latency, and to assess the extent to which the fixes proposed by the authors have effectively improved this characteristic.

Therefore, we used *cyclictest* (with 1,000,000 iterations—more than in the later experiments) to measure the **maximum latency** on a single isolated core, while the non-isolated cores were stressed with programs generating heavy interference (thread creation, memory allocations, network operations, and memory stress).
The paper does not provide details of this experiment beyond the mention of *cyclictest*. It seems to have been conducted on all 24 isolated cores, but no information is given about the number of threads (most likely, as will become clearer later, one thread per isolated core, i.e., 24 threads).
To resolve this ambiguity, we considered **a single isolated core running a single thread.** This choice is also more consistent with the schedulability calculations, which operate at the level of individual cores, and is essentially equivalent to running one thread on one isolated core.

#### Table II - Maximum latency of a single real-time task on an isolated core with cross-core interference, measured with cyclictest, in OpenEuler, Vanilla Linux, and Linux RT

This table shows the maximum latency measured with `cyclictest` (1,000,000 iterations) for a single real-time task pinned to an isolated core, while stressing the non-isolated cores. Lower values indicate lower latency and higher schedulability.

| Configuration    | Open Eulero | Vanilla | Linux RT |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| Max latency (us) | 72          | 153     | 89       |

The data clearly indicate that **OpenEuler achieves significantly lower maximum latencies** compared to Vanilla Linux, and even slightly better results than Linux RT.
The **maximum latency** on OpenEuler is 72 µs, less than half of the 153 µs observed in Vanilla Linux and lower than that of Linux RT. This highlights how the solutions aimed at reducing interference events and cross-core interference are effective and actively decrease the maximum latency of real-time tasks.

### 3.4 How cross-core interference affects the maximum latency of a periodic real-time task (Figure 6a experiment)

In this section, we measure and quantify the extent to which cross-core interference affects the maximum periodic activation latency, that is, the maximum latency observed in periodic tasks with period T.
The maximum activation latency in this case is an important parameter, as it indicates whether the system is able to **meet regular and recurring deadlines** even in the presence of interference, thereby ensuring greater schedulability.

Here, we examine how cross-core interference impacts the maximum latency as the period T varies, in order to test the phenomenon under different **temporal load** conditions.

To verify this, the authors employ *cyclictest*, which measures the wake-up jitter of a periodic thread.
The experiment is conducted by partitioning the cores: a single isolated core runs a high-priority real-time *cyclictest*thread (as indicated in the paper), while the activation period is varied from 50 to 150 µs. The system cores are stressed with programs generating heavy interference (thread creation, memory allocations, network operations, and memory stress).

#### Table III - Maximum latency of a periodic real-time task on an isolated core with varying activation periods under cross-core interference

This table reports the maximum latency of a periodic real-time task as the activation period varies, measured with `cyclictest`. Tests were run on an isolated core while stressing the other cores.  

| Period (us) | Open Eulero (us) | Linux RT (us) | Vanilla (us) |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 50          | 59               | 15            | 391          |
| 70          | 41               | 70            | 24           |
| 90          | 24               | 352           | 48           |
| 110         | 52               | 36            | 32           |
| 130         | 32               | 28            | 56           |
| 150         | 23               | 485           | 33           |

#### Figure 6a - Measured maximum latency of cyclictest on different periods

This figure shows the maximum latency measured with `cyclictest` for a periodic real-time task running on an isolated core. The X-axis represents the activation period of the task in microseconds (µs), while the Y-axis shows the maximum observed latency in µs. Each line corresponds to a different Linux variant: OpenEuler, Linux RT, and Vanilla Linux. 

![](/Users/claudio/Documents/Real time progetto/Immagini per RT/Fig6a.png)

The data clearly show that **the impact of cross-core interference on the activation time of real-time tasks varies significantly across the tested systems.**

- **OpenEuler** maintains relatively low and stable maximum latencies for almost all periods, ensuring robustness under different temporal loads.
- **Vanilla Linux** exhibits latencies similar to OpenEuler, except during the most demanding period (50 µs), where latency rises dramatically (391 µs).
- **Linux RT** displays inconsistent behavior: in some periods, latencies are low (15–36 µs), while in others they increase drastically (352 µs at 90 µs, 485 µs at 150 µs), showing that under different temporal loads the system may fail.

### 3.5 How cross-core interference affects the maximum latency of a real-time task set with an increasing number of threads (Figure 6b experiment)

In this section, we again focus on the maximum activation latency of real-time threads, but this time as a function of the number of threads and, consequently, the **concurrency load**.
This experiment in particular investigates how cross-core interference impacts **activation latency** as the number of real-time threads running on isolated cores increases. To this end, the authors again use *cyclictest*, which measures the wake-up jitter of periodic threads.
The experiment is conducted by running a variable number of high-priority real-time threads (from 1 to 48), all with a 50 µs period, on our four isolated cores, while the non-isolated cores are stressed with programs generating heavy interference (thread creation, memory allocations, network operations, memory stress). Maximum latency is measured in each configuration.

#### Table IV - Maximum latency of a set of real-time tasks on isolated cores with increasing number of threads, measured with cyclictest under cross-core interference

This table presents the maximum latency of a real-time task set with an increasing number of threads, measured with `cyclictest` (period = 50 µs). For 48 threads, the test diverged and the latency exceeded the measurement window.  

| N. Thread | Open Eulero (us) | RT (us) | Vanilla (us) |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 1         | 35               | 20      | 42           |
| 12        | 32               | 32      | 130          |
| 24        | 29               | 45      | 470          |
| 48        | diverge          | diverge | diverge      |

#### Figure 6b -  Measured maximum latency of cyclictest on different threads

This figure shows the maximum latency measured with `cyclictest` for real-time tasks running on isolated cores with a 50 µs period. The X-axis represents the number of threads running simultaneously, while the Y-axis shows the maximum observed latency in microseconds (µs). Each line corresponds to a different Linux variant: OpenEuler, Linux RT, and Vanilla Linux. For 48 threads, the test diverged, therefore, we avoided including it in the figure, as it would have made the graph unreadable.

![](/Users/claudio/Documents/Real time progetto/Immagini per RT/Fig6b.png)

The data highlight that:

- **Increasing the number of real-time threads on isolated cores affects the maximum latency**: as the concurrency load increases on a fixed number of cores, latency naturally rises.
- **OpenEuler** exhibits relatively low and stable latencies up to 24 threads, demonstrating good isolation and resource management. Although the test diverges at 48 threads, the stability observed up to 24 threads indicates that the system can effectively handle a moderate number of simultaneous real-time tasks.
- **Vanilla Linux** shows a drastic increase in latency already at 24 threads (470 µs), confirming that core isolation is insufficient and interference from non-isolated cores rapidly degrades real-time performance.
- **Linux RT** displays intermediate latencies (45 µs at 24 threads) but with a slightly faster increase compared to OpenEuler.
- At 48 threads, measurements diverge across all systems; beyond a certain threshold, load and interference make the results excessive, highlighting the practical limits of the reference hardware for these experiments.

In summary, this experiment confirms that **OpenEuler provides the highest predictability and stability** as the number of real-time tasks increases, whereas Linux RT and Vanilla Linux exhibit significant performance degradation under cross-core interference.

### 3.6 How cross-core interference affects the distribution of activation latencies with cyclictest (Figure 7a experiment)

In this experiment, we focus on the **distribution of activation latencies** of a periodic real-time task, that is, how often a thread is awakened later than its scheduled time. This metric is crucial in real-time systems, because not only the maximum latency matters, but also the frequency with which latencies exceed specific thresholds: high frequencies of delays indicate a system that is **less predictable and more prone to deadline violations.**

This experiment aims to show how cross-core interference influences the **distribution of activation latencies** of a real-time task.
To verify this, we again use *cyclictest*, which measures the wake-up jitter of periodic threads. In the paper, the experiment was performed with 24 threads on 24 isolated cores. To preserve proportionality, we replicated it on four isolated cores, with each core running a high-priority real-time thread with a 50 µs period. As before, the remaining system cores were stressed with programs generating heavy interference (thread creation, memory allocations, network operations, and memory stress).
In this case, we measure how often (i.e., the frequency) the activation latency exceeds a given threshold.

#### Table V – Frequency distribution of activation latencies of a periodic real-time task measured with cyclictest on isolated cores under cross-core interference

This table reports the frequency distribution of activation latencies (counts over 1,000,000 iterations) measured with `cyclictest` (period 50 µs). Higher counts at larger thresholds indicate more frequent long delays.

#### Figure 7a - Latency distribution of cyclictest

This figure shows how often the activation latency of a periodic real-time task exceeds a given threshold, measured with `cyclictest` (period 50 µs) on isolated cores. The X-axis represents latency thresholds in microseconds (µs), while the Y-axis shows the number of occurrences over 1,000,000 iterations. Each line corresponds to a different Linux variant: OpenEuler, Vanilla Linux, and Linux RT. 
The more ‘compact’ the latency graph appears, and the less spread out it is, the better, as this indicates that latencies are consistent and very low and the system is more predictable. Conversely, the more spread out the graph, the more it shows that latencies are variable and frequently higher.

The data clearly show that even **the distribution of real-time task latencies is affected by cross-core interference**:

- **OpenEuler** keeps most activations below very low thresholds: only a few events exceed 50 µs, and almost none surpass 200 µs, indicating highly predictable behavior. Indeed, the graph is the most “compact” at lower latencies, reflecting extreme predictability.
- **Vanilla Linux** exhibits a much higher frequency of latencies exceeding 10–20 µs, with extreme values reaching up to 400 µs, confirming that isolated cores experience significant interference from non-isolated cores and produce more distributed and less predictable results.
- **Linux RT** performs better than Vanilla Linux but worse than OpenEuler: frequent latencies accumulate above 10–20 µs, and values up to 150–200 µs occur regularly, showing a more spread-out behavior compared to OpenEuler.

In summary, this experiment demonstrates that **OpenEuler ensures a much more compact and predictable latency distribution**, drastically reducing the likelihood of high delays. In contrast, Vanilla Linux and Linux RT are more prone to high jitter caused by cross-core interference.

### 3.7 How cross-core interference affects the distribution of latencies with oslat in busy-loop execution (Figure 7b experiment)

In this experiment, we focus on the **latency distribution of a continuously running real-time task (busy-loop)**, that is, the variability of execution times of a high-priority thread that does not perform periodic wake-ups but executes a continuous loop. This characteristic is crucial in real-time systems because it indicates how well the system can execute continuous tasks with predictability and without jitter.

Unlike the other experiments, this measurement was carried out **without additional stress** from the non-isolated cores.

This experiment aims to show how cross-core interference affects the latency distribution when the real-time task does not merely perform periodic wake-ups but executes a continuous busy loop. To investigate this, the authors employ *oslat*, a tool that measures the latency of a high-priority busy-loop thread. The experiment is conducted on a configuration with four isolated cores, each running one measurement thread by default (whereas in the paper, the experiment was performed on 24 isolated cores).

#### Table VI – Latency distribution of a busy-loop real-time task on isolated cores measured with OSLAT without cross-core interference

This table shows the latency distribution of a busy-loop real-time task measured with `oslat`. The values represent the number of occurrences at each latency bucket (in µs). Lower latency buckets with higher counts indicate better predictability.

#### **Figure** 7b - Latency distribution of oslat

This figure shows the number of occurrences for each latency bucket (in microseconds, µs) measured with `oslat` for a high-priority busy-loop thread running on isolated cores. The X-axis represents latency buckets, while the Y-axis shows the number of occurrences. Each line corresponds to a different Linux variant: OpenEuler, Vanilla Linux, and Linux RT. Higher counts at low latency buckets indicate better predictability, reflecting the ability of the system to execute continuous real-time tasks with minimal jitter

![](/Users/claudio/Documents/Real time progetto/Immagini per RT/Fig7b.png)

The data highlight that **OpenEuler provides superior predictability even for real-time tasks executing a continuous busy loop**, without additional interference:

- Most executions on **OpenEuler** are concentrated in the lowest latency buckets (1–3 µs), with very few events exceeding 10 µs, indicating an extremely stable and predictable behavior.
- **Vanilla Linux** exhibits a much more dispersed distribution: although many events occur in the low buckets, numerous occurrences reach tens of microseconds, revealing significantly higher jitter.
- **Linux RT** shows intermediate behavior, with more events beyond the first buckets compared to OpenEuler, but less dispersed than Vanilla Linux, indicating that core isolation is not completely effective even without external interference.

In summary, this experiment confirms that **OpenEuler is able to maintain minimal and consistent latencies even for continuous tasks**, whereas Linux RT and Vanilla Linux are subject to higher jitter.

### 3.8 How cross-core interference affects schedulability under fixed-priority scheduling (Figure 8b experiment)

In this section, we focus on the impact of cross-core interference on the **schedulability** of a set of real-time tasks under **Fixed-Priority (FP) scheduling**, that is, the system’s ability to complete all tasks within their respective deadlines. Schedulability is a crucial metric in real-time systems because it indicates whether the system can correctly handle workloads without violating deadlines, even in the presence of interference from other cores.

In this case, the authors of the paper do not execute the tasks directly on the system, but instead rely on the *SchedCAT*framework, using as input the jitter values previously measured with *cyclictest* (from the maximum latency experiment).

In contrast to the paper, we employ a custom implementation that fulfills all the specified requirements:

- 500 task sets with 40 tasks each, per utilization level
- Execution costs derived from utilization and period
- Periods uniformly distributed in [10, 100] ms
- Implicit deadlines equal to periods
- All tasks assigned a fixed release jitter derived from the maximum latency
- Task priorities assigned according to the Rate Monotonic policy

This procedure was applied to progressively increasing total utilizations [0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 1.00], and repeated for all three kernels under evaluation.
The schedulability analysis of each task set was carried out on a single core, unlike the paper where the evaluation considered 20 cores. This approach was adopted to simplify the schedulability calculation and, moreover, to remain consistent with the jitter values taken from the maximum latency experiment, which was also conducted on a single core.

To achieve this, we used **Response-Time Analysis (RTA) for fixed-priority scheduling with release jitter** as introduced in lesson:

$R_i \;=\; C_i \;+\; B_i \;+\; \sum_{j \in hp(i)} 
\left\lceil \frac{R_i + J_j}{T_j} \right\rceil \, C_j$

This is the “classic” extension of Joseph & Pandya’s RTA to account for jitter (and blocking), further developed in the Audsley–Burns–Tindell–Wellings line of work in the early 1990s.
We solve each task’s response time using a fixed-point iterative approach, from which schedulability of the task set can be easily determined.

In this formula, we will ignore the blocking time since the paper explicitly states that **all tasks are independent and do not share any resources**:

> *“All tasks are independent of each other without any shared resources among them.”*

By definition, this implies that the blocking time is null.

#### Table VII - Schedulability of real-time task sets under Fixed-Priority scheduling with cross-core interference

This table shows the percentage of schedulable task sets under fixed-priority scheduling as total utilization (U) increases. Schedulability was calculated by including the delay caused by cross-core interference measured in Section 3.3. Higher percentages indicate better schedulability.

| U    | Vanilla | Linux RT | Open Euler |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 0.50 | 100%    | 100%     | 100%       |
| 0.60 | 100%    | 100%     | 100%       |
| 0.70 | 100%    | 100%     | 100%       |
| 0.80 | 66.40%  | 69.20%   | 71.60%     |
| 0.85 | 3.80%   | 5.80%    | 6.20%      |
| 0.90 | 0%      | 0%       | 0%         |
| 0.95 | 0%      | 0%       | 0%         |
| 1.00 | 0%      | 0%       | 0%         |

#### Figure 8b - System schedulability of real-time task sets under Fixed-Priority

This figure shows the schedulability of real-time task sets measured using Response-Time Analysis (RTA) for Fixed-Priority scheduling. The X-axis represents the total utilization (U) of the task sets, while the Y-axis shows the percentage of task sets that are schedulable. Each line corresponds to a different Linux variant: OpenEuler, Linux RT, and Vanilla Linux. Higher percentages indicate better system predictability and stronger resistance to cross-core interference, reflecting the system’s ability to meet all task deadlines.

![](/Users/claudio/Documents/Real time progetto/Immagini per RT/Fig8b.png)

The data in Table VII and Figure 8b illustrate how **the schedulability of real-time tasks under Fixed-Priority scheduling** is affected by cross-core interference:

- Up to **U = 0.70**, all kernels achieve 100 % schedulability, indicating that for moderate loads, interference does not compromise task execution.
- At **U = 0.80**, OpenEuler maintains a slightly higher percentage of schedulable tasks (71.6 %) compared to Linux RT (69.2 %) and Vanilla Linux (66.4 %), demonstrating that even at this utilization, OpenEuler produces better results.
- For higher loads (U ≥ 0.85), schedulability drops drastically across all kernels, with OpenEuler still slightly better but still very low (6.2 %), highlighting the practical limits of real-time task management under high congestion.
- At **U ≥ 0.90**, no system guarantees schedulability.

In this case, we observe that OpenEuler achieves better schedulability, though not by a large margin, and overall cross-core interference does not excessively impact fixed-priority single-core scheduling.

### 3.9 How cross-core interference affects ROS2 communication latency (Figure 10 experiment)

In this experiment, we analyze the **maximum communication latency** between nodes in a complex real-time system based on *ROS2*. Communication latency is a crucial indicator of predictability in distributed real-time systems: high or variable latencies can compromise synchronization between nodes and the correct execution of real-time tasks in robotic or industrial applications.

This experiment investigates how cross-core interference affects the maximum communication latency within a **complex real-time** system based on *ROS2*. For this purpose, the authors employ the *iRobot ROS2 Performance* evaluation framework, which measures the maximum message transmission latency between ROS nodes.
The experiment is conducted across different node topologies (*sierra_nevada*, *cedar*, *mont_blanc*, and *white_mountain*), each characterized by a distinct number of nodes and workload intensity. The real-time ROS 2 processes are pinned to the isolated cores with maximum priority, while the non-isolated cores are loaded with workloads generating heavy interference (thread creation, memory allocations, I/O, memory stress). The experiment was run for approximately two minutes, recording the maximum communication latency in three scenarios: RT-Linux without interference, RT-Linux with interference, and openEuler with interference.

#### Table VIII – Maximum communication latency in ROS2 systems under cross-core interference, measured with the ROS2 Performance evaluation framework across different node topologies

This table reports the maximum end-to-end communication latency measured in ROS2 applications across four different node topologies. Latencies were collected  in RT Linux with and without interference an OpenEuler with interference. Lower values indicate safer and more stable communication performance.  

| Scenarios      | RT-Linux  with stress (ms) | openEuler  with stress (ms) | RT-Linux  without stress (ms) |
| -------------- | -------------------------: | --------------------------: | ----------------------------: |
| sierra_nevada  |                    884.535 |                      740.14 |                       785.006 |
| cedar          |                    851.064 |                      721.10 |                       750.309 |
| mont_blanc     |                    903.547 |                      750.00 |                       797.565 |
| white_mountain |                    883.126 |                      738.00 |                       781.556 |

#### Figure 10 - Maximum latency for ROS2

This figure shows the maximum message transmission latency between ROS2 nodes measured using the iRobot ROS2 Performance evaluation framework. The X-axis represents different node topologies (*sierra_nevada*, *cedar*, *mont_blanc*, and *white_mountain*), and the Y-axis shows the latency in milliseconds (ms). Three scenarios are compared: RT-Linux without interference, RT-Linux under interference, and OpenEuler under interference. Lower values indicate safer and more stable communication performance, conversely, higher latency values can compromise the correct execution of applications.

![](/Users/claudio/Documents/Real time progetto/Immagini per RT/Fig10.png)

The data in Table VIII and Figure 10 show how **communication latency in real-time ROS2 systems** is affected by cross-core interference:

- **OpenEuler** maintains lower communication latencies compared to RT-Linux under stress, with values ranging from 721 ms to 740 ms, demonstrating greater **resilience** even in complex scenarios with high load on non-isolated cores. This enables correct and stable execution, reducing the risks for robotic or industrial applications.
- **RT-Linux under stress** exhibits significantly higher latencies (851–904 ms), highlighting that cross-core interference heavily impacts real-time middleware performance, degrading end-to-end response between nodes. This could compromise the execution of such applications.
- **RT-Linux without stress** maintains intermediate latencies (750–798 ms), confirming that the observed difference is primarily due to interference from non-isolated cores rather than the middleware itself.

## Section 4 - Discussion

Starting with the first experiment, the **Ftrace analysis** clearly shows that openEuler exhibits the fewest interference events during the 10-second tracing window with background interference from the other cores. The numbers are not dramatically different from those of **Linux RT**, but both are better than the **Vanilla kernel**. As reported in the paper, despite the applied modifications, interference events are not completely eliminated in openEuler: **a fewer number of unavoidable events remain**, tied to fundamental aspects of kernel operation.
This is consistent with the results shown in Figure 5 of the paper (where we unfortunately did not capture a rare TLB flush event), which also demonstrates that interference events persist in openEuler. The reason why, despite core isolation and the use of openEuler with *interference-free* mechanisms, some events (e.g., residual IPIs) still occur is clearly explained in **Lesson 3: Synchronization Mechanism Suitable for Isolation** of the paper.

The authors state:

> *“In existing Linux, it is almost impossible to completely eliminate synchronization between cores. Thus, we can hardly avoid the interference introduced by synchronization. Our current effort alleviates the interference, but it cannot fully address the interference because we did not choose to completely redesign the synchronization system.”*

In short, in current Linux **it is impossible to fully eliminate inter-core synchronization**, and therefore some interference is inevitable. Their intervention greatly mitigated the issue, but did not resolve it completely, precisely because they chose not to redesign the synchronization system from scratch (to avoid compromising fundamental kernel logic). This also connects to other reasons highlighted in **Lesson 1** of the paper:

> *“It is impossible to fix all cross-core interference bugs in Linux. The key reason is that Linux does not have a well-designed mechanism to enforce isolation between cores.”*

It should also be noted that the **limitation observed during isolation** (see chapter 7.2) did not cause major problems in the subsequent experiments, which remained consistent with the results in the paper. This issue likely introduced additional interference and worsened the results, but in a **uniform way across all three kernels**, such that proportionality among them was preserved. 

Regarding the **maximum latency calculation**, the data are consistent not only with the paper but also with the Ftrace event counts: **openEuler is lower and similar to RT**, while Vanilla is much worse. The relative differences between the kernels align with the paper, although the baseline latency achieved in openEuler is drastically different (12 µs versus 72 µs). This discrepancy is certainly due to hardware differences, yet the overall consistency is still acceptable. As we will see later, the improvement in maximum latency also has consequences for schedulability.

The results of Figure 6a, however, are less aligned. Looking at the critical data, we expected decreasing results across all three kernels, since increasing the wake-up period should physiologically reduce latency. This occurred only in **openEuler**, partially in **Vanilla**, and very poorly in **Linux RT**, where the data exhibited a veritable *rollercoaster*. Based on the paper (and the experiments before and after), we expected Linux RT to be clearly better than Vanilla. However, despite Vanilla’s poor performance at a 50 µs wake-up period, its trend is solidly better than that of Linux RT. This unexpected behavior may limit the significance of the experiment, but it still provides an interesting observation: openEuler follows an excellent trend as the temporal load varies outperforming the other two and aligning with theoretical expectations.

Moving to Figure 6b, a clarification is needed: as explained earlier, I stopped at **24 threads**, since the paper conducted the experiment on 24 isolated cores and 48 threads simply represented twice that number. In my case, with only 4 isolated cores, the results with 48 threads diverged excessively, reaching nearly seconds in all three kernels, which would have been impossible to represent graphically. Nevertheless, I carried out the 48-thread experiments for completeness, and, as a side note, openEuler still performed best among the three.
Looking at the more reliable data, our Figure 6b is fairly consistent and shows the expected increasing trends for Vanilla and Linux RT. For openEuler, the trend even appears to decrease (clearly impossible), but the differences are so small that they rather suggest stability and predictability on varying temporal load. As expected, this stability is lost at 48 threads, where the results diverge (though still less severely than in the other kernels). Here Linux RT performs better than Vanilla and comes close to openEuler, yielding results overall consistent with the paper and satisfactory.

Figure 7a, on the other hand, shows results that align very well with the paper: openEuler is the best in terms of frequency distribution, never exceeding 200 µs of latency, with most values concentrated near zero**. Linux RT and Vanilla are closer to each other**, both reaching maximum latencies of around 400 µs, with wider distributions. The only inconsistency lies in the absolute values, which can easily be explained by hardware differences, even though the experiment was conducted equivalently (24 cores and 24 threads in their case, 4 cores and 4 threads in mine).

The same applies to Figure 7b, conducted with a different tool (*oslat*). The results are highly consistent, further confirming the validity of the experiment.

Moving on to the schedulability tests in figure 8b, since we used the maximum latency values from Table 4.2 (already consistent), we expected—and indeed obtained—similarly coherent results, despite relying on our own homemade software.
The **best performer is OpenEuler**, which theoretically allows tasks to be scheduled efficiently on a single core up to a utilization of 0.8, but collapses already at 0.85. The other kernels follow the expected trend: Linux RT is understandably very close (given the values from Section 4.2), while Vanilla is slightly worse.
Compared to the paper, the differences among the kernels are narrower. This is due to the values in Section 4.2 (which are already quite consistent) and more because the schedulability was analysed for a **single-core **(the justification for this choice can be found in Section 3.3), whereas the paper evaluated schedulability on **20-core**, where differences between results are naturally more pronounced. 

Finally, we conclude with the ROS2 experiments. Here too, the differences between kernels are consistent with the paper: openEuler under stress slightly outperforms RT-Linux without stress, which in turn is significantly better than RT-Linux with stress. The absolute values differ greatly from those in the paper (expressed in milliseconds rather than microseconds), likely due to differences in how latency was computed. Furthermore, the simplest ROS2 test, *cedar*, turned out to be the second-worst performer. Nonetheless, we remain satisfied with the proportional consistency with the paper, thus, we can state that OpenEuler ensures greater system stability and a lower risk of errors.

## Section 5 - Conclusion

In conclusion, we first confirm that the current **Linux kernel is indeed a source of temporal interference**, that this phenomenon results in worse performance in terms of latency, schedulability, and system predictability and that the isolation mechanisms provided by the operating system are insufficient due to cross-core interference. 

We also confirm that, despite the **bug-fixing efforts**, the phenomenon still persists, although in an attenuated form. 

Through the subsequent experiments, we **quantify** the extent to which the phenomenon has been **mitigated**. The absolute values are **worse than those reported in the paper**, likely due to the significantly less powerful hardware available: With slower processors, operations take significantly longer to complete, and with slower or smaller memory, reading or writing data requires more time, increasing the overall duration and consequently generating higher latency for a task set with the same workload. Furthermore, considering that in some experiments the paper had 20 isolated cores available compared to our 4 isolated cores, worse results are physically expected. 

Nevertheless, the **proportional values remain** similar and show very consistent trends. In fact, in line with the findings of the paper and despite hardware differences, **openEuler consistently emerges as the best-performing system** in every experiment, though in our case its performance is **closer to Linux RT** than reported by the original authors. 

This means that, as confirmed by our experiments, under cross-core interference, OpenEuler consistently exhibits lower latencies, which we have seen translate into higher schedulability, since a lower maximum latency allows a larger number of real-time tasks to meet their deadlines. Furthermore, these lower minimum latency values are also observed in periodic tasks under variations of temporal load and concurrency load. As also confirmed by our experiments, the frequency distributions are more compact and centered around the minimum values, indicating a more predictable system that is less prone to deadline violations.
Even in more practical and industrial applications such as ROS2, OpenEuler has shown better performance, demonstrating greater **resilience** even in complex scenarios with high load on non-isolated cores, thereby enabling correct, stable execution with reduced risks for robotic or industrial applications

Finally, even my preliminary and somewhat exploratory event-counting experiments appear to confirm the relationship between the number of interference events and performance degradation: more interference events correspond to worse results, with Linux RT and openEuler performing relatively close to one another and both significantly better than Vanilla. While these data are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions, they provide an interesting and theoretically consistent suggestion that could be validated with further experiments.



##  Section 6  - Implementation Details

In this chapter, we describe the implementation details of the experiments presented in Chapter 3, along with our practical experiences regarding what worked well and what did not. The purpose of this chapter is twofold: to enable readers to easily replicate all the experiments from the paper, and to provide an implementation guide for isolating the Linux operating system using all the mechanisms currently available.

### 6.1 Introduction

The experiments were carried out on a machine equipped with an **Intel i7-3770** processor, featuring 4 physical cores and 8 logical cores.
Regarding the kernels, we considered three configurations:

- Linux Vanilla Kernel 5.10
- LinuxRT Kernel 5.10
- openEuler 22.03 Kernel (based on Linux Vanilla 5.10)

For the first two kernels, we used **Ubuntu** as the operating system, since it provides out-of-the-box support for most of the tools required for both implementation and experimentation.

For the openEuler kernel, instead, we relied on the **openEuler 22.03** distribution itself, as it was not possible to compile this kernel on Ubuntu alongside the other two.

As already mentioned, these versions of Linux and LinuxRT were selected because the authors’ modifications had not yet been integrated upstream, thus providing a solid reference point for evaluating the additional changes introduced by openEuler

### 6.2 Choice of Isolation Configuration

**Selection of cores to isolate**

Following Table 3 strictly, I decided to replicate the setup by assigning 4 isolated cores and 4 non-isolated cores dedicated to generating interference.

The choice of which cores to isolate and which to leave non-isolated was largely constrained by the hardware, since the **Intel i7-3770** processor features **4 physical cores** with **Hyper-Threading**, yielding a total of **8 logical cores**. Each physical core therefore exposes two “twin” logical CPUs, grouped as follows: (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7).

This aspect is crucial when designing core isolation. In fact, from a real-time perspective, it makes little sense to isolate one logical CPU for real-time tasks while using its twin to generate interference, since they share pipelines, L1/L2 caches, and other hardware resources. This would result in physical interference despite the software-level isolation mechanisms described later.

For this reason, the chosen configuration was:

- **Isolated cores**: (2,6) and (3,7)
- **System cores**: (0,4) and (1,5)

This choice ensures correct behavior even with Hyper-Threading enabled. In single-core real-time experiments, when one logical CPU is dedicated to real-time tasks, its twin remains fully idle (since system and interference generation run exclusively on the other cores). In multi-core real-time experiments, the physical pairing of logical CPUs instead helps performance, as both threads of the core are dedicated to the real-time workload.

It should also be noted that NUMA-related considerations are excluded from this procedure, since our system does not feature a NUMA architecture.

### 6.3 Implementation of Core Isolation

This paragraph presents the implementation of the isolation mechanisms for Ubuntu (applicable to both the Linux *Vanilla*and LinuxRT kernels) and for openEuler

#### **1. Kernel Compilation Options**

It is necessary to verify that the kernel has been compiled with the following options:

```
CONFIG_NO_HZ=y  
CONFIG_NO_HZ_COMMON=y  
CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y
```

#### **2. Kernel Boot Parameters**

The following parameters must be passed to GRUB:

```
isolcpus=2,3,6,7 nohz_full=2,3,6,7 rcu_nocbs=2,3,6,7 irqaffinity=0-1,4-5 pcie_aspm=off
```

#### **3. Disable irqbalance**

On both openEuler and Ubuntu:

```
sudo systemctl stop irqbalance.service
sudo systemctl disable irqbalance.service
```

#### **4. Set IRQ affinity only on system cores**

On both openEuler and Ubuntu, IRQ affinity is set to CPUs 0–1,4–5:

```
for i in $(grep -E '^[0-9]+' /proc/interrupts | cut -d: -f1); do
  echo 0-1,4-5 | sudo tee /proc/irq/$i/smp_affinity_list >/dev/null
done
```

#### **5. Disable THP**

On both openEuler and Ubuntu:

```
echo never | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

From personal experience, on Ubuntu with the RT kernel `5.10.0-30-rt-amd64` this file does not exist, which indicates that THP is disabled at compile time—an acceptable outcome.

#### **6. Disable `memory.move_charge_at_immigrate` (cgroups v1)**

1. Check if the file exists:

```
ls /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.move_charge_at_immigrate
```

1. If it exists, disable it:

```
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.move_charge_at_immigrate
```

In my experience:

- **openEuler** uses cgroups v1 with the memory controller, so the file **exists** and was disabled.
- **Ubuntu** does not expose this file, and the behavior is not applicable.

#### **7. Disable KSM**

On both openEuler and Ubuntu, disable KSM and its NUMA node merging:

```
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/merge_across_nodes
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run
```

#### **8. Move `kswapd` to system cores**

1. Identify the PIDs of `kswapd` processes:

```
ps -eLo pid,psr,comm | grep kswapd
```

Example output:

```
123   6 kswapd0
124   7 kswapd1
```

1. Move each PID to non-isolated cores (e.g., 0–1,4–5):

```
sudo taskset -pc 0-1,4-5 123
sudo taskset -pc 0-1,4-5 124
```

Expected output:

```
pid 123's current affinity list: 0-7
pid 123's new affinity list: 0-1,4-5
```

#### **9. Restrict `pcrypt` to system cores**

On both Ubuntu and openEuler:

1. Check if the `pcrypt` module is active:

```
lsmod | grep pcrypt
```

If no output appears, the module is likely not loaded, and this step does not apply unless IPsec or disk encryption with pcrypt support is used.

1. If active, set the CPU mask:

```
echo 0-1,4-5 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/pcrypt/pdecrypt/parallel_cpumask
echo 0-1,4-5 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/pcrypt/pdecrypt/serial_cpumask
```

Depending on the kernel version, you may find only `parallel_cpumask`, or both `pcrypt/parallel_cpumask` and `serial_cpumask`.

If the files do not exist:

- The `pcrypt` module is not loaded, or
- The kernel was compiled without pcrypt support.

In my experience, this feature was absent in both operating systems.

#### 10. Limiting the Workqueue cpumask to System Cores (⚠️ problematic)

On both openEuler and Ubuntu:

1. Set the CPU mask for workqueues:

```
echo 0-1,4-5 | sudo tee /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask
```

**My experience**

When attempting to use the command:

```
echo 0-1,4-5 | sudo tee /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask
```

the system returned:

```
tee: /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask: Invalid argument
```

This indicates that the kernel refused the write operation to the `cpumask` file.

Further checks confirmed that `kworker` threads continued to run on isolated cores:

```
ps -eLo pid,psr,comm | grep kworker 
# No output = expected behavior
```

Ideally, no output should appear, but in practice threads still ran on cores 2–3 and 6–7.

I also tried with another option, which was `kthread_cpus=0-1,4-5` on grub, which ensures that kernel threads run only on the system cores.

Yet I still observed an issue: when checking whether `kworker` threads were running on isolated cores with:

```
ps -eLo pid,psr,comm | grep kworker | awk '$2 >= 2 && $2 <= 3 || $2 >= 6 && $2 <= 7'
# No output = expected behavior
```

We would expect no output, but in practice some threads still appeared. 
This suggests that the parameter `kthread_cpus=0-1,4-5` **does not work fully as intended**. A possible explanation is that it is not retroactive, meaning it does not apply restrictions to `kworker` threads already active before the GRUB parameters took effect.

 This shows that neither the `workqueue/cpumask` setting nor the `kthread_cpus=0-1,4-5` GRUB parameter was fully effective.

#### 11. Disable Timer Migration

On both openEuler and Ubuntu (runtime):

```
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/timer_migration
```

#### 12. RCU Non-Preemptible (rcu_normal=1)

On both openEuler and Ubuntu:

```
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/rcu_normal
```

#### 13. Disable RT Runtime/Period Limits

On both openEuler and Ubuntu:

```
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us
```

On openEuler, this worked without issue.

On Ubuntu, writing to `sched_rt_period_us` returned an `Invalid argument` error. However, since `sched_rt_runtime_us = -1`, the period value was effectively ignored, so the problem had no practical impact.

#### 14. Disable Swap

On both openEuler and Ubuntu:

1. Disable swap:

```
sudo swapoff -a
```

#### What did not work?

Everything was correctly isolated **except for kworker threads**. Specifically:

- `echo 0-1,4-5 > /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask` was rejected by the kernel.
- `kthread_cpus=0-1,4-5` did not reliably restrict kworkers.
- Alternative attempts also failed:
  - `taskset -pc` → returned *Invalid argument* (kernel rejected affinity changes for kworkers).
  - `/sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask` → ignored by the kernel.
  - `cpuset` (cgroups v1) → did not enforce migration.

As a result, kworkers continued to run on isolated cores (2,3,6,7). Nevertheless, they were not visible in Ftrace measurements, which suggests they did not have a major impact on the experiments.



### 6.4 Controlled Interference Setup

```
taskset -c 0-3 stress-ng --cpu 4 --vm 2 --sock 2 --timer 2 --pagefault 2 --iomix 2
```

- **Taskset**: a utility used to set or read CPU affinity for a process. Any process launched with this command is restricted to the specified cores and will not be scheduled elsewhere.
- **`stress-ng`**: a versatile stress-testing tool.
- **`--cpu 4`**: launches 4 CPU-bound workers, each performing intensive user-space computations.
- **`--vm 2`**: launches 2 “virtual memory” workers repeatedly allocating and freeing memory (`mmap/munmap`), creating memory-management pressure.
- **`--sock 2`**: launches 2 socket workers that open, use, and close TCP/UDP connections, stressing the networking stack.
- **`--timer 2`**: launches 2 workers that repeatedly create timers, stressing the kernel’s timer subsystem.
- **`--pagefault 2`**: launches 2 workers generating page faults, forcing the kernel to map/manage memory pages on demand.
- **`--iomix 2`**: launches 2 mixed I/O workers performing diverse operations (file, network, memory), introducing heterogeneous load.

**`fork_asid_stress.c`**:
This program repeatedly calls `fork()` in an infinite loop. Each child immediately calls `_exit(0)`, and the parent continues. The result is an intense process turnover, forcing the kernel to constantly create and destroy processes. This stresses PID management, process structures, and indirectly the TLB/ASID subsystem. Under multicore workloads, the frequent context switches can trigger TLB flushes and inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) to maintain translation consistency, increasing background noise that impacts timing predictability.

**`calc_pi_stress.c`**:
This program calculates π in an infinite loop using the Leibniz series. It is a purely compute-bound workload, with heavy floating-point usage. Additionally, each approximation is printed (`printf("pi ≈ ...")`), generating I/O overhead on stdout.

**`nic_flusher.sh`**:
A Bash script that repeatedly creates dummy network interfaces (`ip link add dummy$i type dummy`), brings them up, and then deletes them.

**`workqueue_spammer.c`**:
A “softer” variant of process churn that does not directly interact with the kernel’s workqueue subsystem. It repeatedly calls `fork()`, immediately terminates the child, waits with `waitpid()`, and inserts small pauses with `usleep()`. This generates interference primarily in user space: stressing the scheduler, recycling PIDs, and partially exercising the TLB/ASID system under concurrency, without queueing actual work to kworkers or triggering kernel workqueues.

### 6.5 Ftrace Implementation

Here we describe the interference events we chose to “count,” which are the same categories cited in the paper.

| Interference Type (macro-category) | Which bugs trigger it (from the paper)                       | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IPI handling**                   | - Workqueues waking threads on all cores - Global TLB flush  | An Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI) is sent or received. If received by an isolated core → cross-core disturbance. |
| **Context switch**                 | - Workqueue (waking workers on isolated cores) - Incoherent task migration - Locks on jiffies - Global statistics updates (vmstat_shepherd) | The isolated core performed a context switch to execute an undesired thread or was blocked due to locks. |
| **TLB flush**                      | - ASID reuse forcing extra TLB flushes on isolated cores - Forced TLB flush via global IPI | The TLB cache of a core was invalidated → loss of performance and increased latency on isolated cores. |

We compiled a list of all the ftrace log events of interest:

1. **Context switch**

Look for:

- `__schedule`
- `schedule` | `schedule_idle`
- `context_switch`
- `finish_task_switch`
- `prepare_task_switch`
- `rcu_note_context_switch`
- `raw_spin_rq_lock_nested`
- `update_rq_clock`

1. **IPI handling (Inter-Processor Interrupts)**

Look for:

- `flush_smp_call_function_queue`
- `__flush_smp_call_function_queue`
- `__smp_call_single_queue`
- `call_function_single_prep_ipi`
- `smp_call_function`
- `smp_call_function_single`
- `smp_call_function_many`
- `smp_call_function_many_cond`
- `smp_call_function_interrupt` *(some versions)*
- `generic_smp_call_function_single_interrupt` *(other versions)*
- `irq_work_queue_on`
- `irq_work_single`
- `scheduler_ipi` / `reschedule_interrupt` / `smp_reschedule_interrupt` *(depends on architecture/kernel)*

1. **TLB flush**

Look for:

- `flush_tlb_func` *(typical remote handler via IPI)*
- `flush_tlb_mm` / `flush_tlb_page` / `flush_tlb_range`
- `native_flush_tlb_global` / `native_flush_tlb_one_user` / `native_flush_tlb_multi`
- `arch_flush_tlb_*` *(architecture-specific prefixes)*
- `flush_tlb_ipi` / `flush_tlb_func_remote` *(if present in that kernel version)*

A simple script was then used to scan ftrace logs for these events:

```
#!/bin/bash
FILE="core4_trace.txt"

echo "=== Event count in $FILE ==="

echo
echo "--- Context Switch ---"
grep -E "__schedule|context_switch|finish_task_switch|prepare_task_switch|rcu_note_context_switch|raw_spin_rq_lock_nested|update_rq_clock" "$FILE" | wc -l

echo
echo "--- IPI ---"
grep -E "flush_smp_call_function_queue|__flush_smp_call_function_queue|__smp_call_single_queue|call_function_single_prep_ipi|smp_call_function|smp_call_function_single|smp_call_function_many|smp_call_function_many_cond|smp_call_function_interrupt|generic_smp_call_function_single_interrupt|irq_work_queue_on|irq_work_single|scheduler_ipi|reschedule_interrupt|smp_reschedule_interrupt" "$FILE" | wc -l

echo
echo "--- TLB flush ---"
grep -E "flush_tlb_func|flush_tlb_mm|flush_tlb_page|flush_tlb_range|native_flush_tlb_global|native_flush_tlb_one_user|native_flush_tlb_multi|arch_flush_tlb_|flush_tlb_ipi|flush_tlb_func_remote" "$FILE" | wc -l
```

### 6.6 Max Latency under Interference

We measured the maximum latency on isolated core 2 using the command:

```
taskset -c 2 cyclictest -p99 -t1 -i50 -l1000000 --policy fifo
```

(one million iterations to better capture kernel behavior), executed in parallel with the interference setup described earlier. This test was run with a single thread on a single isolated core.

### 6.7 Figure 6a

In this case, maximum latency was measured at different periods (50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150 µs) using the command:

```
taskset -c 2 cyclictest -p99 -t1 -l100000 --policy fifo
```

where the `-i` option was varied according to the specified periods. As in the paper, we employed a single real-time thread on a single isolated core (*“we fix the number of threads of each isolated core to one”*).

### 6.8 Figure 6b

We used the following command:

```
taskset -c 2,6,3,7 cyclictest -p99 -t$THREADS -i50 -l100000 --policy fifo --histogram=10000
```

where the number of threads was varied (1, 12, 24, 48). In this experiment, all four isolated cores (2, 6, 3, 7) were used.

### 6.9 Figure 7a

We counted how often (frequency) latency exceeded a given threshold across one million iterations. In the paper, the experiment was performed with 24 threads, whereas here it was executed with a single thread to highlight trends more clearly.

The command used was:

```
taskset -c 2 cyclictest -p99 -t1 -i50 -l1000000 --policy fifo
```

and the latencies of each iteration were classified through a script.

Data were grouped into coarser bins, as the goal was not fine-grained measurement but simply to confirm the overall trend—which indeed emerged clearly.

### 6.10 Figure 7b (Oslat)

In this experiment, we used **`oslat`** to measure the latency distribution on isolated cores (CPUs 2, 3, 6, 7), replicating the configuration used in the *Interference-Free Operating System* paper (conducted on their 24 isolated cores).

As reported in the paper, the measurement was performed without additional stress on the non-isolated cores.

The command used was:

```
sudo oslat -c 2,6,3,7 -C 2 -f 99 -D 1m --bucket-size 256 --json oslat_wide.json
```

### 6.11 Figure 8b Schedulability with Fixed Priority

The paper requires checking schedulability under **Fixed Priority** scheduling, while adhering to the following constraints:

- **“500 task sets per configuration”** → `NUM_TASKSETS = 500`
- **40 task for taskset** → `NUM_TASKS = 40`
- **“Execution costs based on utilization and period”** → `cost = u × T(period)`
- **“Periods uniformly distributed in [10, 100] ms”** → `random.uniform(*PERIOD_RANGE_MS)` with `(10, 100)`
- **“Implicit deadline = period”** → `deadline = period`
- **“All tasks have a release jitter”** → assign `jitter` to every task
- **Release jitter taken from the maximum latency results** → values from Section 4.2 of the paper
- **Task priorities assigned by Rate Monotonic** → our program sorts tasks by period

#### Algorithm

To compute schedulability, we used **Response-Time Analysis (RTA) for fixed-priority scheduling with release jitter** (and blocking, which in our case is ignored).

$R_i \;=\; C_i \;+\; B_i \;+\; \sum_{j \in hp(i)} 
\left\lceil \frac{R_i + J_j}{T_j} \right\rceil \, C_j$

This is the classical extension of Joseph & Pandya’s RTA to account for jitter (and blocking), developed in the Audsley–Burns–Tindell–Wellings line of work in the early 1990s.
We solve each task’s response time using a fixed-point iterative method, from which schedulability of the entire task set can be easily determined.

#### Task Set Generation

We generate a **complete task set ready for analysis**, given the number of tasks, total utilization, period range, release jitter (taken from maximum latency results), and blocking (set to zero in our case).

- Draw `n = number of tasks per task set`.
- Sample periods uniformly in the range [10–100] ms.
- Use the `UUniFast` function to distribute total utilization across the `n` tasks.
- Assign implicit deadlines (D=T), release jitter, and blocking according to the parameters provided (blocking = 0).

```
def generate_taskset(n, U_total, period_range=(10.0, 100.0),
                     jitter=DEFAULT_RELEASE_JITTER_MS, blocking=0.0):
    """
    Generate a task set with n tasks and total utilization U_total.
    Each task is a dict with keys: T, C, D, J, B.
    - Periods uniform in period_range
    - C = u * T (from UUniFast)
    - D = T (implicit deadline)
    - J = jitter (default fixed)
    - B = blocking (default fixed)
    """
    utils = uunifast(n, U_total)
    ts = []
    for u in utils:
        T = random.uniform(*period_range)
        C = u * T
        ts.append({
            'T': T,
            'C': C,
            'D': T,
            'J': jitter,
            'B': blocking,
            'response_time': None
        })
    return ts

def uunifast(n, u_total):
    """
    UUniFast: generate n utilizations summing to u_total.
    Returns a list of n floats.
    """
    utils, sum_u = [], float(u_total)
    for i in range(1, n):
        next_u = sum_u * (random.random() ** (1.0 / (n - i)))
        utils.append(sum_u - next_u)
        sum_u = next_u
    utils.append(sum_u)
    return utils
```

#### Response Time Computation

This is the *engine* of the analysis: it computes the Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) for each task using RTA under RM (Rate Monotonic: shorter periods ⇒ higher priority).

Procedure:

- Sort tasks by increasing period (RM priority assignment).
- For each task, compute iteratively:
  - Start with `C + B`.
  - Add interference from higher-priority tasks, counting how many jobs may arrive in the response window considering jitter.
  - Iterate until convergence (fixed-point) or until the response time exceeds the deadline.

```
def compute_response_times_rm(ts, jitter_default=DEFAULT_RELEASE_JITTER_MS,
                              blocking_default=DEFAULT_BLOCKING_MS, max_iters=MAX_ITERS):
    """
    Compute response times R_i for task set 'ts' using
    fixed-priority RTA under RM (Rate Monotonic).
    Each task requires: 'T' (period), 'C' (WCET).
    Optional fields defaulted: 'D' (deadline), 'J' (jitter), 'B' (blocking).
    Updates in place: ts[i]['response_time'].
    """
    # Initialize defaults
    for t in ts:
        t.setdefault('D', t['T'])
        t.setdefault('J', jitter_default)
        t.setdefault('B', blocking_default)
        t['response_time'] = None

    # RM ordering by period
    ts.sort(key=lambda x: x['T'])

    # Fixed-point iteration per task
    for i, ti in enumerate(ts):
        R_prev = -1.0
        R = float(ti['C'] + ti['B'])
        iters = 0

        while R != R_prev and iters < max_iters:
            iters += 1
            R_prev = R

            interference = 0.0
            for j in range(i):  # higher-priority tasks
                tj = ts[j]
                jobs = math.ceil((R_prev + tj['J']) / tj['T'])
                interference += jobs * tj['C']

            R = ti['C'] + ti['B'] + interference
            if R > ti['D']:
                break  # early exit

        ti['response_time'] = R
```

#### Schedulability Test

We check whether all tasks satisfy `R ≤ D`. If so, the task set is schedulable under RM with jitter; otherwise, it is not.

```
def is_schedulable(ts):
    """
    Return True if all tasks satisfy R_i <= D_i.
    Assumes compute_response_times_rm has been called.
    """
    return all(('response_time' in t) and (t['response_time'] is not None) and (t['response_time'] <= t['D']) for t in ts)
```

#### Experimental Procedure

We repeated the experiment for total utilizations:
U=[0.50,0.60,0.70,0.80,0.85,0.90,0.95,1.00]

- For each utilization, 500 independent task sets were generated.
- For each set, schedulability was tested.
- Results were reported as the percentage of schedulable task sets per utilization level.

### 6.12 ROS2 – Figure 10

We locally replicated part of the *End-to-End Performance* experiment from the *Interference-Free Operating System* paper. The goal was to measure communication latency between ROS 2 nodes in different scenarios, both without interference and under concurrent load, in order to assess how core isolation and real-time priority affect performance.

#### Tools Used

- **ROS 2 (Jazzy distro)** → middleware framework for distributed robotics, based on DDS.
- **`irobot_benchmark`** → ROS 2 application that generates predefined node/topic scenarios and measures latencies.
- **`colcon`** → build system for ROS 2.
- **`stress-ng`** → tool for generating controlled CPU, I/O, and memory load.
- **`taskset`** → Linux command for binding a process to a specific set of cores.
- **`chrt`** → command to assign real-time priority to a process (`SCHED_FIFO`).

#### Environment Preparation

1. Installed ROS 2 and required development packages (`ament_cmake`, `rclcpp`, etc.).

2. Cloned the `ros2-performance` repository containing `irobot_benchmark`.

3. Built the workspace with:

   ```
   colcon build --packages-select irobot_benchmark
   ```

4. Verified the executable was available at:

   ```
   /root/performance_ws/install/irobot_benchmark/lib/irobot_benchmark/
   ```

#### Test Scenarios

The scenarios are JSON files defining:

- The **number of ROS 2 nodes**.
- The **topology** of publisher/subscriber connections.
- The **executor type** (single or multiple).

The scenarios used were:

- `sierra_nevada.json` → 10 nodes, low intensity, single executor.
- `cedar.json` → 10 nodes, low intensity, multi-executor.
- `mont_blanc.json` → 20 nodes, medium intensity, single executor.
- `white_mountain.json` → 20 nodes, high intensity, multi-executor.

#### Core Binding and Priority

To replicate the paper’s setup:

- **Cores 2,6,3,7**: ROS 2 processes (scenarios).
- **Cores 0,4,1,5**: interference load when enabled.

Command used to bind processes and set real-time priority:

```
taskset -c 2,6,3,7 chrt -f 99 ./irobot_benchmark topology/<scenario>.json
```

`SCHED_FIFO 99` ensures that the process runs at the highest real-time priority and cannot be preempted by non-RT processes on the same cores.

#### Execution

All four scenarios were executed under three conditions:

- Linux RT kernel without interference,
- Linux RT kernel with interference,
- openEuler with interference.

Example command:

```
taskset -c 2,6,3,7 chrt -f 99 ./irobot_benchmark topology/sierra_nevada.json
```

and similarly for the other scenarios.

#### Data Collection and Analysis

- Each run generates a folder `<scenario>_log` containing:
  - `latency_all.txt` → per-message latency measurements.
  - `latency_total.txt` → aggregated statistics (min, max, avg, stddev).
  - `resources.txt` → CPU and memory usage.
- A parsing script was used to extract the maximum latency (in ms) for each scenario.

The experiment was run for approximately two minutes, recording the maximum communication latency.
