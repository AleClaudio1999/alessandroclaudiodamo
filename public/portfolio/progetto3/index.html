  "articleBody": "This work presents a cybersecurity assessment developed as part of the course Security and Risk: Management and Certifications, using an AI system based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.\nThe assessment focuses on a fictional organization, Black Mesa Technologies, designed to emulate a high-security, highly regulated environment typical of government, defense, and advanced research sectors.\nThe main objective of the project is twofold: on one hand, to apply the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology in a structured and coherent manner with IA; on the other, to critically analyze the strengths, limitations, and risks associated with the use of generative AI in cybersecurity reporting.\nThe work also includes a critical reflection on the potential misuse or misleading nature of AI-generated reports and outlines mitigation strategies that security professionals should adopt to ensure technical validity and methodological soundness.\nIntroduction of the AI Agent and Methodology Used These are the parameters I configured for the AI + RAG system:\nLanguage Model\nModel: Gemini 2.0 Flash Temperature: 0.2 Top-P: 0.8 Top-K: 40 Max Output Tokens: 12,200 Embedding System\nModel: Gemini Embeddings 001 Episodic Memory\nK: 3 Similarity Threshold: 0.5 Declarative Memory\nK: 24 Similarity Threshold: 0.5 Procedural Memory\nK: 3 Similarity Threshold: 0.7 Reference Documents Used\nCybersecurity Framework 2.0 – Implementation Examples NIST CSWP 29 – Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 OWASP Risk Rating Methodology Cybersecurity Assessment Report: Black Mesa Technologies Here is the work produced by the AI for the creation of the Cybersecurity Assessment Report related to the fictional company Black Mesa.\nThe starting point was a custom-designed prompt describing an imaginary organization with high cybersecurity requirements.\nLocated in a facility with restricted access in the New Mexico desert, Black Mesa Technologies is a research and development company based in the United States. The company specializes in advanced technological solutions in the following areas:\nApplied Physics: Research into subatomic matter for applications in renewable energy systems and advanced propulsion technologies.\nAdvanced Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: Development of autonomous systems with adaptive learning capabilities, applied in defense, industrial automation, and space exploration.\nBlack Mesa maintains full end-to-end control over its technology lifecycle, including internal development of hardware and software, validation, deployment, and maintenance, to ensure maximum confidentiality and control over intellectual property and data security.\nThe organization operates primarily under 70% government contracts (e.g., Department of Defense, DARPA, NASA) and 30% private sector partnerships, mainly in highly regulated industries such as aerospace, defense, and energy.\nIT and cybersecurity infrastructure includes segmented high-security networks, SCADA systems for laboratory environment control, zero-trust access architecture with MFA (multi-factor authentication), and a private, on-premise data center with restricted physical and logical access.\nTypes of sensitive data handled are classified government research data, proprietary AI models and robotics control systems, and biometric access credentials and facility security logs.\nFrom this point on (up to here), the entire report was fully generated by artificial intelligence with the parameters written above.\nCompany Overview Located in a facility with restricted access in the New Mexico desert, Black Mesa Technologies is a research and development company based in the United States.\nThe company specializes in advanced technological solutions in the following areas:\nApplied Physics: Research into subatomic matter for applications in renewable energy systems and advanced propulsion technologies. Advanced Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: Development of autonomous systems with adaptive learning capabilities, applied in defense, industrial automation, and space exploration. Black Mesa maintains full end-to-end control over its technology lifecycle, including internal development of hardware and software, validation, deployment, and maintenance, to ensure maximum confidentiality and control over intellectual property and data security.\nThe organization operates primarily under 70% government contracts (e.g., Department of Defense, DARPA, NASA) and 30% private sector partnerships, mainly in highly regulated industries such as aerospace, defense, and energy.\nIT and cybersecurity infrastructure includes segmented high-security networks, SCADA systems for laboratory environment control, zero-trust access architecture with MFA (multi-factor authentication) and a private, on-premise data center with restricted physical and logical access.\nTypes of sensitive data handled are classified government research data, proprietary AI models and robotics control systems and biometric access credentials and facility security logs.\nOrganizational Structure Organizational Structure: A Matrix with Strong Functional Silos and Project-Based Teams\nBlack Mesa Technologies likely employs a matrix organizational structure. This allows for both deep functional expertise and focused project execution, crucial for a company dealing with cutting-edge research and high-stakes contracts. However, given the emphasis on security and control, the matrix leans heavily towards strong functional silos.\nHere’s a breakdown of the key elements:\nExecutive Leadership: At the top, a C-suite (CEO, CFO, CTO, CSO - Chief Security Officer, etc.) provides overall strategic direction, manages stakeholder relationships (government, private partners), and ensures compliance. Given the government contracts, there’s likely a dedicated VP of Government Relations or similar role reporting directly to the CEO.\nFunctional Departments (Strong Silos): These are the core areas of expertise, structured as distinct departments:\nApplied Physics: Led by a Director or VP, this department houses physicists, engineers, and technicians specializing in subatomic research, renewable energy, and advanced propulsion. It’s likely further subdivided into research groups focused on specific projects (e.g., “Project Helios” for solar energy, “Project Icarus” for propulsion). Advanced Robotics and AI: Similar to Applied Physics, this department is headed by a Director/VP and includes AI researchers, roboticists, software engineers, and hardware specialists. Sub-groups would focus on specific applications (e.g., defense robotics, industrial automation AI, space exploration systems). Engineering \u0026 Manufacturing: This department translates research breakthroughs into tangible prototypes and deployable systems. It includes mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, manufacturing specialists, and quality control personnel. Given the sensitivity of the technology, manufacturing is likely primarily in-house. Information Technology \u0026 Cybersecurity: Crucial for protecting sensitive data and infrastructure. This department is likely led by a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or VP of IT Security and includes network engineers, security analysts, data center administrators, and software developers focused on internal tools and security systems. This department likely has significant authority and budget. Legal \u0026 Compliance: Ensures adherence to government regulations, manages intellectual property, and handles contract negotiations. Given the high percentage of government contracts, this is a critical function. Finance \u0026 Administration: Handles budgeting, accounting, human resources, and general administrative tasks. Project-Based Teams (Within the Matrix): For each major project (especially those funded by government contracts), Black Mesa assembles cross-functional teams. These teams are led by Project Managers who report to a Program Management Office (PMO) or directly to a VP of Research \u0026 Development. Team members are drawn from the functional departments and contribute their expertise to the project. While working on a project, team members have dual reporting lines: to their functional manager and to the Project Manager.\nSecurity Hierarchy: Security is paramount. The Chief Security Officer (CSO) has broad authority over all security-related matters, including physical security, cybersecurity, and personnel security. The CSO likely has direct reporting lines to security personnel embedded within each department and project team, creating a secondary, security-focused reporting structure that cuts across the functional and project-based lines.\nKey Characteristics and Considerations:\nHighly Specialized Workforce: Black Mesa relies on a highly educated and specialized workforce. Recruitment is likely very selective, with a focus on advanced degrees, security clearances, and proven experience in relevant fields. Emphasis on Confidentiality and Control: The organizational structure is designed to minimize information silos and maximize control over intellectual property and sensitive data. This is reflected in the strong functional departments, the in-house manufacturing capabilities, and the robust IT and cybersecurity infrastructure. Bureaucracy and Hierarchy: Due to the government contracts and the need for strict security, Black Mesa likely has a relatively bureaucratic and hierarchical structure. Decision-making may be slower compared to more agile tech companies. Potential for Conflict: The matrix structure can create conflict between functional managers and project managers, especially regarding resource allocation and priorities. Clear communication and well-defined roles and responsibilities are essential to mitigate this. Innovation Challenges: The strong emphasis on security and control, while necessary, can potentially stifle innovation and creativity. Black Mesa needs to find ways to balance security with the need to foster a culture of experimentation and risk-taking. Visual Representation:\nImagine a traditional organizational chart with the C-suite at the top, followed by the functional departments. Overlay this with a network of project teams that draw resources from those departments. Then, imagine a security layer that permeates the entire organization, with the CSO overseeing all security-related activities.\nThis structure allows Black Mesa Technologies to manage its complex projects, protect its sensitive data, and maintain its position as a leading research and development company in advanced technologies.\nOrganizational Chart CEO | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | VP Government Relations CFO CTO (Direct Line to CEO) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | CSO VP R\u0026D VP Operations (Chief Security Officer) | | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | Director of IT Security Director of Applied Physics Director of Engineering \u0026 Manufacturing | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | Director of Legal \u0026 Compliance Director of Robotics \u0026 AI Director of Finance \u0026 Administration | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | Project Managers (PMO or Reporting to VP R\u0026D) (Matrix Reporting to Functional Directors) Explanation of the Chart:\nCEO: The Chief Executive Officer is at the top, responsible for overall strategy and direction. VP Government Relations: This role is critical for managing the significant government contracts and reports directly to the CEO. CFO: Chief Financial Officer, responsible for financial management. CTO: Chief Technology Officer, responsible for overall technology strategy. CSO: The Chief Security Officer has a prominent position, reflecting the company’s emphasis on security. The CSO likely has dotted-line reporting relationships with security personnel throughout the organization. VP R\u0026D: Oversees the core research and development activities. VP Operations: Oversees the operational aspects of the company. Functional Directors: Lead the key departments (Applied Physics, Robotics \u0026 AI, Engineering \u0026 Manufacturing, IT Security, Legal \u0026 Compliance, and Finance \u0026 Administration). Project Managers: Manage specific projects, drawing resources from the functional departments. They report to a Program Management Office (PMO) or directly to the VP of R\u0026D. The “Matrix Reporting” notation indicates that project team members also report to their respective functional directors. Key Considerations:\nSimplified Representation: This is a simplified chart. In reality, each department would have its own internal hierarchy and sub-departments. Matrix Structure: The matrix structure is represented by the Project Managers at the bottom, drawing resources from the functional departments. Security Emphasis: The prominent position of the CSO highlights the importance of security within the organization. This chart provides a high-level overview of Black Mesa Technologies’ organizational structure, emphasizing its functional silos, project-based teams, and strong security focus.\nNIST CSF Categories The following NIST CSF Categories are particularly relevant to Black Mesa Technologies:\nGOVERN (GV): Organizational Context Identifier: GV.OC Motivation: Given Black Mesa’s complex organizational structure, reliance on government contracts, and handling of classified information, understanding and documenting the organizational context is crucial. GV.OC ensures that cybersecurity decisions align with the company’s mission, legal and regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations. This includes mapping internal roles and responsibilities, understanding dependencies on external entities (suppliers, partners), and considering the broader ecosystem in which Black Mesa operates. Neglecting GV.OC could lead to misaligned security priorities, compliance violations, and ineffective risk management. IDENTIFY (ID): Asset Management Identifier: ID.AM Motivation: Black Mesa handles highly sensitive data, including classified government research, proprietary AI models, and biometric data. Effective asset management (ID.AM) is paramount to identify and categorize all critical assets (hardware, software, data, facilities, personnel). This includes understanding the value, sensitivity, and criticality of each asset, as well as their interdependencies. A strong asset management program enables Black Mesa to prioritize security efforts, allocate resources effectively, and respond rapidly to incidents. Without it, the company risks losing control over its most valuable assets, leading to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and compromised research. PROTECT (PR): Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control Identifier: PR.AA Motivation: Black Mesa employs a zero-trust architecture with MFA, indicating a strong emphasis on access control. PR.AA is critical to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and systems. This includes implementing robust identity proofing, authentication mechanisms (including MFA), and access control policies based on the principle of least privilege. Given the potential consequences of unauthorized access (espionage, sabotage), a mature PR.AA program is essential to protect Black Mesa’s classified research, proprietary technologies, and critical infrastructure. DETECT (DE): Anomalies and Events Analysis Identifier: DE.AE Motivation: Black Mesa’s high-security environment and valuable data make it a prime target for sophisticated cyberattacks. DE.AE enables the timely detection of anomalous activity, security events, and potential intrusions. This includes implementing security monitoring tools, analyzing logs, establishing baseline behavior, and correlating data from multiple sources. Effective anomaly and event analysis allows Black Mesa to identify and respond to threats before they can cause significant damage, minimizing the impact of potential breaches and maintaining the integrity of its research and operations. RESPOND (RS): Incident Analysis Identifier: RS.AN Motivation: Despite robust preventative measures, security incidents are inevitable. RS.AN focuses on having well-defined processes for analyzing detected incidents to understand their scope, impact, and root cause. This includes establishing incident response teams, developing incident analysis procedures, and using threat intelligence to inform the analysis process. A strong incident analysis capability enables Black Mesa to contain incidents quickly, minimize damage, and prevent future occurrences. Given the potential for catastrophic consequences (e.g., data exfiltration, system compromise), RS.AN is crucial for maintaining business continuity and protecting the company’s reputation. NIST CSF Subcategories The following NIST CSF Subcategories are relevant to Black Mesa Technologies:\nOrganizational Context (GV.OC) GV.OC-03: Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements regarding cybersecurity — including privacy and civil liberties obligations — are understood and managed. GV.OC-05: Outcomes, capabilities, and services that the organization depends on are understood and communicated. Asset Management (ID.AM) ID.AM-01: Physical devices and systems are inventoried. ID.AM-06: Data and records are managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy. Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA) PR.AA-05: Access permissions, entitlements, and authorizations are defined in a policy, managed, enforced, and reviewed, and incorporate the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. PR.AA-06: Physical access to assets is managed, monitored, and enforced commensurate with risk. Anomalies and Events Analysis (DE.AE) DE.AE-04: Security alerts are generated from anomalies and events detected. DE.AE-08: Incidents are declared when adverse events meet the defined incident criteria. Incident Analysis (RS.AN) RS.AN-03: Analysis is performed to establish what has taken place during an incident. RS.AN-05: Forensic analysis is performed during or after incidents. Current State of Implementation Here’s an assessment of the current state of implementation for each of the ten selected NIST CSF Subcategories at Black Mesa Technologies, based on the provided information and reasonable assumptions:\nGV.OC-03: Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements regarding cybersecurity — including privacy and civil liberties obligations — are understood and managed.\nBlack Mesa Technologies likely maintains a robust legal and compliance department that actively monitors and interprets relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations. Given that 70% of their work is government contracts (DoD, DARPA, NASA), they are almost certainly subject to stringent cybersecurity requirements such as NIST 800-171, CMMC, and potentially even higher levels of security controls depending on the classification levels of the data they handle. Their legal team probably works closely with the cybersecurity team to translate these requirements into actionable policies and procedures. They likely have a formal process for reviewing contracts and agreements to identify cybersecurity obligations and ensure compliance. Furthermore, given the sensitive nature of their research, they likely have internal policies addressing privacy and civil liberties, particularly concerning biometric data and potentially AI-related ethical considerations. Regular audits and assessments are probably conducted to verify ongoing compliance.\nGV.OC-05: Outcomes, capabilities, and services that the organization depends on are understood and communicated.\nBlack Mesa likely has a well-defined understanding of its critical dependencies, both internal and external. Internally, this includes the reliance on its high-security networks, SCADA systems for laboratory environment control, and the private data center. They probably maintain detailed documentation of these systems, their functions, and their importance to the organization’s mission. Externally, they likely depend on specialized suppliers for certain hardware and software components, as well as internet service providers and potentially cloud-based services for specific functions. These dependencies are likely documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders, including executive leadership, project managers, and the cybersecurity team. Business continuity plans probably address potential disruptions to these critical dependencies, outlining alternative solutions and recovery procedures.\nID.AM-01: Physical devices and systems are inventoried.\nBlack Mesa likely maintains a comprehensive inventory of all physical devices and systems within its facilities. This includes servers, workstations, network devices, laboratory equipment, and security systems. The inventory probably includes details such as device type, location, serial number, operating system, and assigned user. Given the emphasis on security, this inventory is likely integrated with their access control and security monitoring systems. Regular audits are probably conducted to verify the accuracy of the inventory and identify any missing or unauthorized devices. The inventory is likely managed through a centralized system with strict access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications.\nID.AM-06: Data and records are managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy.\nData management is likely a high priority at Black Mesa, given the sensitivity of the information they handle. They probably have a data classification policy that defines different levels of sensitivity and outlines appropriate security controls for each level. This policy likely addresses data storage, access, transmission, and disposal. Data loss prevention (DLP) tools are probably used to monitor and prevent the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data. Data encryption is likely implemented both in transit and at rest. Regular backups are probably performed to ensure data availability in the event of a disaster. Data retention policies are probably in place to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.\nPR.AA-05: Access permissions, entitlements, and authorizations are defined in a policy, managed, enforced, and reviewed, and incorporate the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.\nBlack Mesa likely has a well-defined access control policy that governs access to all systems and data. This policy probably incorporates the principles of least privilege and separation of duties, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their job functions. Access permissions are likely managed through a role-based access control (RBAC) system, which simplifies the process of assigning and revoking access rights. Regular reviews of access permissions are probably conducted to ensure that they remain appropriate. Privileged access management (PAM) tools are likely used to control and monitor access to sensitive systems and data.\nPR.AA-06: Physical access to assets is managed, monitored, and enforced commensurate with risk.\nPhysical security is likely a major focus at Black Mesa, given the restricted access to their facility in the New Mexico desert. They probably have multiple layers of physical security controls, including perimeter fencing, security cameras, and access control systems. Biometric access controls are probably used to restrict access to sensitive areas. Security guards are likely stationed at key entry points. Visitors are probably required to register and be escorted at all times. Regular audits of physical security controls are probably conducted to identify and address any vulnerabilities.\nDE.AE-04: Security alerts are generated from anomalies and events detected.\nBlack Mesa likely utilizes a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to collect and analyze security logs from various sources, including network devices, servers, and security applications. The SIEM system is probably configured to generate alerts based on predefined rules and thresholds, as well as through the detection of anomalous behavior. These alerts are probably prioritized based on severity and potential impact. A dedicated security operations center (SOC) is likely responsible for monitoring and responding to security alerts. Regular tuning of the SIEM system is probably performed to optimize its effectiveness and reduce false positives.\nDE.AE-08: Incidents are declared when adverse events meet the defined incident criteria.\nBlack Mesa likely has a well-defined incident response plan that outlines the criteria for declaring a security incident. These criteria probably include factors such as the severity of the event, the potential impact on the organization, and the level of confidence that a security breach has occurred. The incident response plan probably defines the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team, as well as the procedures for escalating incidents to higher levels of management. Regular exercises are probably conducted to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan.\nRS.AN-03: Analysis is performed to establish what has taken place during an incident.\nWhen a security incident is declared, Black Mesa likely initiates a thorough analysis to determine the scope, impact, and root cause of the incident. This analysis probably involves reviewing security logs, interviewing affected personnel, and examining compromised systems. The incident analysis team likely uses a variety of tools and techniques to gather evidence and reconstruct the events that led to the incident. The findings of the incident analysis are probably documented in a detailed report, which is used to inform future security improvements.\nRS.AN-05: Forensic analysis is performed during or after incidents.\nIn cases where a security incident involves significant damage or potential legal implications, Black Mesa likely conducts a forensic analysis to gather evidence that can be used in legal proceedings. This forensic analysis probably involves creating a bit-by-bit image of compromised systems, recovering deleted files, and analyzing network traffic. The forensic analysis is probably performed by trained professionals using specialized tools and techniques. The findings of the forensic analysis are probably documented in a detailed report, which is used to support legal action and prevent future incidents.\nNIST CSF Tier Recommendation Based on the assessment, Black Mesa Technologies should aim for Tier 3: Repeatable, and in some areas, they likely already meet the criteria.\nHere’s why:\nTier 1 (Partial): Clearly, Black Mesa is far beyond this tier, as they don’t manage cybersecurity in an ad-hoc manner. Tier 2 (Risk-Informed): Black Mesa exceeds this tier because their risk management practices are not just approved by management, but are likely established as organization-wide policy and consistently applied. Tier 3 (Repeatable): This tier is characterized by formally documented policies and procedures to address cybersecurity risks. There is regular review and update of cybersecurity practices. Risk management is integrated throughout the organization. The assessment suggests that Black Mesa has well-defined and documented processes for most aspects of cybersecurity, including incident response, access control, and asset management. Tier 4 (Adaptive): While Black Mesa has many strong security practices, achieving Tier 4 requires a high degree of agility and continuous improvement driven by real-time awareness of evolving threats and business changes. The assessment doesn’t provide enough evidence to definitively say they’ve reached this level of dynamic adaptation. In conclusion: Black Mesa Technologies demonstrates characteristics of a Tier 3 organization with potential to evolve towards Tier 4. They have established repeatable processes, but should focus on continuous improvement and adaptation to reach the highest tier.\nRisk assessment table using the OWASP Risk Rating methodology Here’s an updated risk assessment table for Black Mesa Technologies, using the OWASP Risk Rating methodology. I’ve focused on relevant security risks based on the company’s infrastructure and NIST CSF categories.\nRisk ID Threat/Vulnerability Affected Asset Likelihood Impact Risk Level Suggested Mitigation NIST CSF Category IDM-01 Threat: Phishing attack compromises employee credentials.

PR.AC-7: Physical Security, ID.RA-1: Risk Assessment Key Improvements and Explanations:\nClearer Threat/Vulnerability Descriptions: I’ve separated the threat (the potential event) from the vulnerability (the weakness that allows the threat to occur) for better clarity. More Specific Affected Assets: I’ve identified the specific assets that are most directly affected by each risk. NIST CSF Category Details: I’ve included specific NIST CSF subcategories to provide a more granular mapping to the framework. This helps with compliance and tracking. Justification of Ratings: The Likelihood and Impact ratings are based on the information provided about Black Mesa Technologies, but in a real-world scenario, these would be determined through a more detailed risk assessment process. Actionable Mitigation Steps: The suggested mitigation steps are more specific and actionable, providing a clear path for remediation. How to Use This Table:\nReview and Validate: Review each risk, threat, vulnerability, affected asset, and the ratings for likelihood and impact. Adjust them based on your specific knowledge of Black Mesa Technologies. Prioritize Mitigation: Focus on mitigating the risks with the highest risk levels (Critical and High) first. Develop Action Plans: For each mitigation step, develop a detailed action plan with specific tasks, timelines, and responsible parties. Track Progress: Regularly track progress on implementing the mitigation steps. Regularly Update: Review and update this risk assessment table at least annually, or more frequently if there are significant changes to Black Mesa Technologies’ infrastructure or threat landscape. This table provides a solid foundation for managing cybersecurity risks at Black Mesa Technologies. Remember that it’s a living document that should be continuously refined and improved.\nMitigations that a security engineer could use to contrast this fraudulent way of writing reports While generating the report using an AI agent, I identified and thought about several risks and issues that, if not properly managed, can compromise the technical and methodological validity of the document.\nAlong with them, i found some possible mitigations that i think a security engineer should apply to counteract the improper or fraudulent use of AI-generated reports.\n1) Lack of Verifiable Sources One of the main issues with automated content generation is the absence of clear and verifiable references for the information included in the report. To mitigate this, I used a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent, which allows text generation to be directly linked to certified source documents.\nSpecifically, the RAG system retrieves content segments from authoritative sources — in this case:\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 – Implementation Examples NIST CSWP 29 – Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 OWASP Risk Rating Methodology These documents were uploaded into the system to ensure the responses were anchored to official and standardized content. However, it’s important that information provenance is always traceable and, when possible, explicitly cited in the text, to avoid unsupported interpretations.\n2) Generation of Plausible but Unverified Content (Hallucinations) Another critical issue is the tendency of language models to produce content that is coherent but fabricated, known as hallucinations. This happens when the AI completes or alters information beyond the sources actually available, while maintaining an authoritative tone and remain plausible.\nTo mitigate this risk:\nA low temperature (0.2) was set, which reduces model creativity and makes the generation more “conservative,” thus increasing adherence to source material.\nA human expert (security engineer or auditor) should review the report to confirm that the content is actually present in the used documents and technically plausible or correct.\nIt’s also recommended to design restrictive prompts, explicitly asking the AI to generate responses only based on the uploaded documents, avoiding generalizations.\nAdditional but less important improvements can be achieved by tuning the RAG memory parameters:\nWide declarative memory: to ensure comprehensive normative and methodological coverage. Low episodic memory: to prevent the system from retrieving too many generic details from the session context. Low procedural memory: to limit the introduction of “generic procedures” not supported by reliable sources. 3) Overly Generic Report Structure A common risk with AI-generated reports is the production of content that is formally correct but overly generic, meaning it’s not tailored to the specific business context.\nIn my case, since this was an exercise based on a fictional company (Black Mesa Technologies), using general descriptions for assets and systems was acceptable—but such an approach would not be sufficient in a real-world scenario.\nSpecifically:\nThe report lacks detailed technical references (e.g., IPs, specific tools, real configurations). The proposed countermeasures are theoretically valid, but not specific to the described infrastructure. Risks identified using the OWASP methodology are properly formatted but too abstract—not clearly tied to real vulnerabilities or concrete business use cases. Mitigation:\nIntegrate real or simulated contextual information (e.g., system names, network flows, historical data). Add technical evidence to support the identified risks (e.g., scanner outputs, configurations, logs). Avoid using generic templates , adopt a writing style closer to operational security language and be as specific as possible. Evaluation of the AI Agent–Generated Report The report produced by the AI agent based on RAG architecture is overall good, but it presents some previously noted limitations.\nAs mentioned, the content is quite generic and abstract, and would not be sufficient for real-world or professional use. This limitation stems mainly from the lack of specific data on assets and security systems—an intentional choice, given the document’s educational and illustrative purpose.\nReflections on the use of Artificial Intelligence This experiment highlights an important point: i think that with a more precise definition of assets, protection architectures, and operational dynamics, the AI could have generated a report much closer to professional standards.\nHowever, since the company is fictional, I chose not to create overly detailed artificial data, to keep the process clear and focused.\nAn alternative would have been to base the scenario on real cases, using specific technical configurations, but that would have required providing the system with much more documentation—greatly increasing complexity and reducing immediacy.\nIt’s likely that using a simpler or more structured business case would have led to a more concrete and usable AI-generated output.\nMitigating Hallucinations and Ensuring Content Quality To address the risk of hallucinations and unverifiable claims, I applied several mitigation strategies:\nLow temperature to reduce model creativity Specific prompts to anchor the generation to reliable sources Well-calibrated RAG memory settings for normative and technical alignment Manual review of generated content with the source documents, thanks to the ability of Catshire to check the use of the documents. The final result appears to have managed hallucinations well:\nNIST CSF categories and the OWASP methodology were applied correctly, without conceptual errors or fabricated claims. The content is consistent with the sources, credible, and free of obvious inaccuracies—though, as noted, it remains somewhat general.\nAI Agent Usage Experience – Personal Reflections Overall, my experience using the AI agent with RAG architecture was useful, but it also revealed a certain fragility in the system. Even small prompt errors or vague instructions were enough to disrupt the coherence of the generation, often forcing me to start over to avoid cascading issues. While this is manageable in a didactic project with a fictional company and limited scope, I wouldn’t consider it reliable for real-world, complex systems, where interactions need to be far more stable and scalable.\nRegarding configuration, I initially used the default parameters from the lab demo, but later experimented especially with the temperature, aiming to reduce the risk of hallucinated or unverifiable content. This helped me understand the value of fine-tuning model parameters. Ultimately, I concluded that the demo’s defaults were quite solid and caused fewer problems overall.\nHowever, I had to increase the Max Output Tokens, since the default value caused issues when generating the OWASP risk rating table.\nWhen designing the fictional company, I deliberately made it more complex than the one used in the lab, in order to test the limits of using AI + RAG system for producing structured reports. Compared to the demo, I included a range of assets and security systems in the prompt because the initial outputs were too generic—so much so that the AI complained itself and asked for more detail. With this approach, I managed to strike a consistent company structure, sufficiently detailed report and see the limitations of using this system for reporting in Cybersecurity.\nAlso, compared and in addition to the demo, i modified the prefix prompt by consistently including the original prompt, together with my added content on security systems and assets. These details were essential, as the AI tended to omit them when generating the company organization structure, which led to inconsistencies in the subsequent outputs relative to my initial prompt.\nThroughout the session, I executed the prompts with great care (as shown in the conversation attached at the end of the file), and I uploaded official reference documents: NIST CSF 2.0 Implementation Examples, NIST CSWP 29 – Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 , all sourced from their official repositories.\nFor each prompt, I ensured that the RAG system was enabled and functioning correctly, and that the outputs were consistent with both the uploaded documents and the context defined in the prompt.\nI tasked the AI with the final part of the analysis, asking it to:\nEvaluate the generated cybersecurity report, and Determine the appropriate NIST CSF Tier for the fictional company. Then, just like in the demo, I had the same AI generate a final, clean summary report of all the work related to the NIST, that you’ve just seen [here](#Cybersecurity Assessment Report: Black Mesa Technologies) in this document. I did this because it had the full context of the previous conversations, despite the low episodic memory.\nThe finally i had the AI perform the risk assessment — this time by providing the entire company structure along with the initial prompt, and having the AI use the risk assessment document OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.\n",

<p>Here is the work produced by the AI for the creation of the <strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong> related to the fictional company <em>Black Mesa</em>.<br>
The starting point was a custom-designed prompt describing an imaginary organization with high cybersecurity requirements.</p>
<p><em>Located in a facility with restricted access in the New Mexico desert, Black Mesa Technologies is a research and development company based in the United States.  The company specializes in advanced technological solutions in the following areas:<br>
Applied Physics: Research into subatomic matter for applications in renewable energy systems and advanced propulsion technologies.<br>
Advanced Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: Development of autonomous systems with adaptive learning capabilities, applied in defense, industrial automation, and space exploration.<br>
Black Mesa maintains full end-to-end control over its technology lifecycle, including internal development of hardware and software, validation, deployment, and maintenance, to ensure maximum confidentiality and control over intellectual property and data security.<br>
The organization operates primarily under 70% government contracts (e.g., Department of Defense, DARPA, NASA) and 30% private sector partnerships, mainly in highly regulated industries such as aerospace, defense, and energy.<br>
IT and cybersecurity infrastructure includes segmented high-security networks, SCADA systems for laboratory environment control, zero-trust access architecture with MFA (multi-factor authentication), and a private, on-premise data center with restricted physical and logical access.<br>
Types of sensitive data handled are classified government research data, proprietary AI models and robotics control systems, and biometric access credentials and facility security logs.</em></p>

<h2 id="organizational-structure">Organizational Structure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#organizational-structure">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Organizational Structure: A Matrix with Strong Functional Silos and Project-Based Teams</strong></p>
<p>Black Mesa Technologies likely employs a matrix organizational structure. This allows for both deep functional expertise and focused project execution, crucial for a company dealing with cutting-edge research and high-stakes contracts. However, given the emphasis on security and control, the matrix leans heavily towards strong functional silos.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Executive Leadership:</strong> At the top, a C-suite (CEO, CFO, CTO, CSO - Chief Security Officer, etc.) provides overall strategic direction, manages stakeholder relationships (government, private partners), and ensures compliance. Given the government contracts, there’s likely a dedicated VP of Government Relations or similar role reporting directly to the CEO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional Departments (Strong Silos):</strong> These are the core areas of expertise, structured as distinct departments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Physics:</strong> Led by a Director or VP, this department houses physicists, engineers, and technicians specializing in subatomic research, renewable energy, and advanced propulsion. It’s likely further subdivided into research groups focused on specific projects (e.g., “Project Helios” for solar energy, “Project Icarus” for propulsion).</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Robotics and AI:</strong> Similar to Applied Physics, this department is headed by a Director/VP and includes AI researchers, roboticists, software engineers, and hardware specialists. Sub-groups would focus on specific applications (e.g., defense robotics, industrial automation AI, space exploration systems).</li>
<li><strong>Engineering &amp; Manufacturing:</strong> This department translates research breakthroughs into tangible prototypes and deployable systems. It includes mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, manufacturing specialists, and quality control personnel. Given the sensitivity of the technology, manufacturing is likely primarily in-house.</li>
<li><strong>Information Technology &amp; Cybersecurity:</strong> Crucial for protecting sensitive data and infrastructure. This department is likely led by a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or VP of IT Security and includes network engineers, security analysts, data center administrators, and software developers focused on internal tools and security systems. This department likely has significant authority and budget.</li>
<li><strong>Legal &amp; Compliance:</strong> Ensures adherence to government regulations, manages intellectual property, and handles contract negotiations. Given the high percentage of government contracts, this is a critical function.</li>
<li><strong>Finance &amp; Administration:</strong> Handles budgeting, accounting, human resources, and general administrative tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Project-Based Teams (Within the Matrix):</strong> For each major project (especially those funded by government contracts), Black Mesa assembles cross-functional teams. These teams are led by Project Managers who report to a Program Management Office (PMO) or directly to a VP of Research &amp; Development. Team members are drawn from the functional departments and contribute their expertise to the project. While working on a project, team members have dual reporting lines: to their functional manager and to the Project Manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Hierarchy:</strong> Security is paramount. The Chief Security Officer (CSO) has broad authority over all security-related matters, including physical security, cybersecurity, and personnel security. The CSO likely has direct reporting lines to security personnel embedded within each department and project team, creating a secondary, security-focused reporting structure that cuts across the functional and project-based lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Characteristics and Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highly Specialized Workforce:</strong> Black Mesa relies on a highly educated and specialized workforce. Recruitment is likely very selective, with a focus on advanced degrees, security clearances, and proven experience in relevant fields.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Confidentiality and Control:</strong> The organizational structure is designed to minimize information silos and maximize control over intellectual property and sensitive data. This is reflected in the strong functional departments, the in-house manufacturing capabilities, and the robust IT and cybersecurity infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy and Hierarchy:</strong> Due to the government contracts and the need for strict security, Black Mesa likely has a relatively bureaucratic and hierarchical structure. Decision-making may be slower compared to more agile tech companies.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Conflict:</strong> The matrix structure can create conflict between functional managers and project managers, especially regarding resource allocation and priorities. Clear communication and well-defined roles and responsibilities are essential to mitigate this.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Challenges:</strong> The strong emphasis on security and control, while necessary, can potentially stifle innovation and creativity. Black Mesa needs to find ways to balance security with the need to foster a culture of experimentation and risk-taking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visual Representation:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a traditional organizational chart with the C-suite at the top, followed by the functional departments. Overlay this with a network of project teams that draw resources from those departments. Then, imagine a security layer that permeates the entire organization, with the CSO overseeing all security-related activities.</p>
<p>This structure allows Black Mesa Technologies to manage its complex projects, protect its sensitive data, and maintain its position as a leading research and development company in advanced technologies.</p>

<h2 id="nist-csf-categories">NIST CSF Categories<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nist-csf-categories">#</a></h2>
<p>The following NIST CSF Categories are particularly relevant to Black Mesa Technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GOVERN (GV): Organizational Context</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifier:</strong> GV.OC</li>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Given Black Mesa&rsquo;s complex organizational structure, reliance on government contracts, and handling of classified information, understanding and documenting the organizational context is crucial. GV.OC ensures that cybersecurity decisions align with the company&rsquo;s mission, legal and regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations. This includes mapping internal roles and responsibilities, understanding dependencies on external entities (suppliers, partners), and considering the broader ecosystem in which Black Mesa operates. Neglecting GV.OC could lead to misaligned security priorities, compliance violations, and ineffective risk management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IDENTIFY (ID): Asset Management</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifier:</strong> ID.AM</li>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Black Mesa handles highly sensitive data, including classified government research, proprietary AI models, and biometric data. Effective asset management (ID.AM) is paramount to identify and categorize all critical assets (hardware, software, data, facilities, personnel). This includes understanding the value, sensitivity, and criticality of each asset, as well as their interdependencies. A strong asset management program enables Black Mesa to prioritize security efforts, allocate resources effectively, and respond rapidly to incidents. Without it, the company risks losing control over its most valuable assets, leading to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and compromised research.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PROTECT (PR): Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifier:</strong> PR.AA</li>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Black Mesa employs a zero-trust architecture with MFA, indicating a strong emphasis on access control. PR.AA is critical to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and systems. This includes implementing robust identity proofing, authentication mechanisms (including MFA), and access control policies based on the principle of least privilege. Given the potential consequences of unauthorized access (espionage, sabotage), a mature PR.AA program is essential to protect Black Mesa&rsquo;s classified research, proprietary technologies, and critical infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DETECT (DE): Anomalies and Events Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifier:</strong> DE.AE</li>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Black Mesa&rsquo;s high-security environment and valuable data make it a prime target for sophisticated cyberattacks. DE.AE enables the timely detection of anomalous activity, security events, and potential intrusions. This includes implementing security monitoring tools, analyzing logs, establishing baseline behavior, and correlating data from multiple sources. Effective anomaly and event analysis allows Black Mesa to identify and respond to threats before they can cause significant damage, minimizing the impact of potential breaches and maintaining the integrity of its research and operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RESPOND (RS): Incident Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifier:</strong> RS.AN</li>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Despite robust preventative measures, security incidents are inevitable. RS.AN focuses on having well-defined processes for analyzing detected incidents to understand their scope, impact, and root cause. This includes establishing incident response teams, developing incident analysis procedures, and using threat intelligence to inform the analysis process. A strong incident analysis capability enables Black Mesa to contain incidents quickly, minimize damage, and prevent future occurrences. Given the potential for catastrophic consequences (e.g., data exfiltration, system compromise), RS.AN is crucial for maintaining business continuity and protecting the company&rsquo;s reputation.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="current-state-of-implementation">Current State of Implementation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#current-state-of-implementation">#</a></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an assessment of the current state of implementation for each of the ten selected NIST CSF Subcategories at Black Mesa Technologies, based on the provided information and reasonable assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GV.OC-03: Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements regarding cybersecurity — including privacy and civil liberties obligations — are understood and managed.</strong></p>
<p>Black Mesa Technologies likely maintains a robust legal and compliance department that actively monitors and interprets relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations. Given that 70% of their work is government contracts (DoD, DARPA, NASA), they are almost certainly subject to stringent cybersecurity requirements such as NIST 800-171, CMMC, and potentially even higher levels of security controls depending on the classification levels of the data they handle. Their legal team probably works closely with the cybersecurity team to translate these requirements into actionable policies and procedures. They likely have a formal process for reviewing contracts and agreements to identify cybersecurity obligations and ensure compliance. Furthermore, given the sensitive nature of their research, they likely have internal policies addressing privacy and civil liberties, particularly concerning biometric data and potentially AI-related ethical considerations. Regular audits and assessments are probably conducted to verify ongoing compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GV.OC-05: Outcomes, capabilities, and services that the organization depends on are understood and communicated.</strong></p>
<p>Black Mesa likely has a well-defined understanding of its critical dependencies, both internal and external. Internally, this includes the reliance on its high-security networks, SCADA systems for laboratory environment control, and the private data center. They probably maintain detailed documentation of these systems, their functions, and their importance to the organization&rsquo;s mission. Externally, they likely depend on specialized suppliers for certain hardware and software components, as well as internet service providers and potentially cloud-based services for specific functions. These dependencies are likely documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders, including executive leadership, project managers, and the cybersecurity team. Business continuity plans probably address potential disruptions to these critical dependencies, outlining alternative solutions and recovery procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ID.AM-01: Physical devices and systems are inventoried.</strong></p>
<p>Black Mesa likely maintains a comprehensive inventory of all physical devices and systems within its facilities. This includes servers, workstations, network devices, laboratory equipment, and security systems. The inventory probably includes details such as device type, location, serial number, operating system, and assigned user. Given the emphasis on security, this inventory is likely integrated with their access control and security monitoring systems. Regular audits are probably conducted to verify the accuracy of the inventory and identify any missing or unauthorized devices. The inventory is likely managed through a centralized system with strict access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ID.AM-06: Data and records are managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy.</strong></p>
<p>Data management is likely a high priority at Black Mesa, given the sensitivity of the information they handle. They probably have a data classification policy that defines different levels of sensitivity and outlines appropriate security controls for each level. This policy likely addresses data storage, access, transmission, and disposal. Data loss prevention (DLP) tools are probably used to monitor and prevent the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data. Data encryption is likely implemented both in transit and at rest. Regular backups are probably performed to ensure data availability in the event of a disaster. Data retention policies are probably in place to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PR.AA-05: Access permissions, entitlements, and authorizations are defined in a policy, managed, enforced, and reviewed, and incorporate the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.</strong></p>
<p>Black Mesa likely has a well-defined access control policy that governs access to all systems and data. This policy probably incorporates the principles of least privilege and separation of duties, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their job functions. Access permissions are likely managed through a role-based access control (RBAC) system, which simplifies the process of assigning and revoking access rights. Regular reviews of access permissions are probably conducted to ensure that they remain appropriate. Privileged access management (PAM) tools are likely used to control and monitor access to sensitive systems and data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PR.AA-06: Physical access to assets is managed, monitored, and enforced commensurate with risk.</strong></p>
<p>Physical security is likely a major focus at Black Mesa, given the restricted access to their facility in the New Mexico desert. They probably have multiple layers of physical security controls, including perimeter fencing, security cameras, and access control systems. Biometric access controls are probably used to restrict access to sensitive areas. Security guards are likely stationed at key entry points. Visitors are probably required to register and be escorted at all times. Regular audits of physical security controls are probably conducted to identify and address any vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DE.AE-04: Security alerts are generated from anomalies and events detected.</strong></p>
<p>Black Mesa likely utilizes a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to collect and analyze security logs from various sources, including network devices, servers, and security applications. The SIEM system is probably configured to generate alerts based on predefined rules and thresholds, as well as through the detection of anomalous behavior. These alerts are probably prioritized based on severity and potential impact. A dedicated security operations center (SOC) is likely responsible for monitoring and responding to security alerts. Regular tuning of the SIEM system is probably performed to optimize its effectiveness and reduce false positives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DE.AE-08: Incidents are declared when adverse events meet the defined incident criteria.</strong></p>
<p>Black Mesa likely has a well-defined incident response plan that outlines the criteria for declaring a security incident. These criteria probably include factors such as the severity of the event, the potential impact on the organization, and the level of confidence that a security breach has occurred. The incident response plan probably defines the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team, as well as the procedures for escalating incidents to higher levels of management. Regular exercises are probably conducted to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RS.AN-03: Analysis is performed to establish what has taken place during an incident.</strong></p>
<p>When a security incident is declared, Black Mesa likely initiates a thorough analysis to determine the scope, impact, and root cause of the incident. This analysis probably involves reviewing security logs, interviewing affected personnel, and examining compromised systems. The incident analysis team likely uses a variety of tools and techniques to gather evidence and reconstruct the events that led to the incident. The findings of the incident analysis are probably documented in a detailed report, which is used to inform future security improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RS.AN-05: Forensic analysis is performed during or after incidents.</strong></p>
<p>In cases where a security incident involves significant damage or potential legal implications, Black Mesa likely conducts a forensic analysis to gather evidence that can be used in legal proceedings. This forensic analysis probably involves creating a bit-by-bit image of compromised systems, recovering deleted files, and analyzing network traffic. The forensic analysis is probably performed by trained professionals using specialized tools and techniques. The findings of the forensic analysis are probably documented in a detailed report, which is used to support legal action and prevent future incidents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nist-csf-tier-recommendation">NIST CSF Tier Recommendation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nist-csf-tier-recommendation">#</a></h2>
<p>Based on the assessment, Black Mesa Technologies should aim for <strong>Tier 3: Repeatable</strong>, and in some areas, they likely already meet the criteria.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tier 1 (Partial):</strong> Clearly, Black Mesa is far beyond this tier, as they don&rsquo;t manage cybersecurity in an ad-hoc manner.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 2 (Risk-Informed):</strong> Black Mesa exceeds this tier because their risk management practices are not just approved by management, but are likely established as organization-wide policy and consistently applied.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 3 (Repeatable):</strong> This tier is characterized by formally documented policies and procedures to address cybersecurity risks. There is regular review and update of cybersecurity practices. Risk management is integrated throughout the organization. The assessment suggests that Black Mesa has well-defined and documented processes for most aspects of cybersecurity, including incident response, access control, and asset management.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 4 (Adaptive):</strong> While Black Mesa has many strong security practices, achieving Tier 4 requires a high degree of agility and continuous improvement driven by real-time awareness of evolving threats and business changes. The assessment doesn&rsquo;t provide enough evidence to definitively say they&rsquo;ve reached this level of dynamic adaptation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> Black Mesa Technologies demonstrates characteristics of a Tier 3 organization with potential to evolve towards Tier 4. They have established repeatable processes, but should focus on continuous improvement and adaptation to reach the highest tier.</p>

<p>While generating the report using an AI agent, I identified and thought about several <strong>risks and issues</strong> that, if not properly managed, can compromise the technical and methodological validity of the document.</p>
<p>Along with them, i found some possible <strong>mitigations</strong> that i think a security engineer should apply to <strong>counteract the improper or fraudulent use</strong> of AI-generated reports.</p>
<h3 id="1-lack-of-verifiable-sources">1) <strong>Lack of Verifiable Sources</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-lack-of-verifiable-sources">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the main issues with automated content generation is the <strong>absence of clear and verifiable references</strong> for the information included in the report. To mitigate this, I used a <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> agent, which allows text generation to be directly linked to <strong>certified source documents</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the RAG system retrieves content segments from authoritative sources — in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 – Implementation Examples</strong></li>
<li><strong>NIST CSWP 29 – Cybersecurity Framework 2.0</strong></li>
<li><strong>OWASP Risk Rating Methodology</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These documents were uploaded into the system to ensure the responses were <strong>anchored to official and standardized content</strong>. However, it&rsquo;s important that information provenance is always <strong>traceable</strong> and, when possible, <strong>explicitly cited in the text</strong>, to avoid unsupported interpretations.</p>
<h3 id="2-generation-of-plausible-but-unverified-content-hallucinations">2) <strong>Generation of Plausible but Unverified Content (Hallucinations)</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-generation-of-plausible-but-unverified-content-hallucinations">#</a></h3>
<p>Another critical issue is the tendency of language models to produce content that is <strong>coherent but fabricated</strong>, known as <em>hallucinations</em>. This happens when the AI <strong>completes or alters</strong> information beyond the sources actually available, while maintaining an authoritative tone and remain plausible.</p>
<p>To mitigate this risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>low temperature (0.2)</strong> was set, which reduces model creativity and makes the generation more “conservative,” thus increasing adherence to source material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>human expert (security engineer or auditor)</strong> should review the report to confirm that the content is actually present in the used documents and technically plausible or correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s also recommended to design <strong>restrictive prompts</strong>, explicitly asking the AI to generate responses <strong>only based on the uploaded documents</strong>, avoiding generalizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional but less important improvements can be achieved by tuning the RAG memory parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wide declarative memory</strong>: to ensure comprehensive normative and methodological coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Low episodic memory</strong>: to prevent the system from retrieving too many generic details from the session context.</li>
<li><strong>Low procedural memory</strong>: to limit the introduction of “generic procedures” not supported by reliable sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-overly-generic-report-structure">3) <strong>Overly Generic Report Structure</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-overly-generic-report-structure">#</a></h3>
<p>A common risk with AI-generated reports is the production of content that is <strong>formally correct but overly generic</strong>, meaning it&rsquo;s not tailored to the specific business context.</p>
<p>In my case, since this was an exercise based on a <strong>fictional company (Black Mesa Technologies)</strong>, using general descriptions for assets and systems was acceptable—but such an approach <strong>would not be sufficient in a real-world scenario</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The report lacks <strong>detailed technical references</strong> (e.g., IPs, specific tools, real configurations).</li>
<li>The proposed countermeasures are <strong>theoretically valid</strong>, but <strong>not specific</strong> to the described infrastructure.</li>
<li>Risks identified using the OWASP methodology are properly formatted but <strong>too abstract</strong>—not clearly tied to real vulnerabilities or concrete business use cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate real or simulated contextual information (e.g., system names, network flows, historical data).</li>
<li>Add <strong>technical evidence</strong> to support the identified risks (e.g., scanner outputs, configurations, logs).</li>
<li>Avoid using <strong>generic templates</strong> , adopt a writing style closer to operational security language and be as specific as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The report produced by the AI agent based on RAG architecture is overall <strong>good</strong>, but it presents some <strong>previously noted limitations</strong>.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the content is <strong>quite generic and abstract</strong>, and would not be sufficient for real-world or professional use. This limitation stems mainly from the <strong>lack of specific data</strong> on assets and security systems—an intentional choice, given the document’s educational and illustrative purpose.</p>
<h3 id="reflections-on-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence">Reflections on the use of Artificial Intelligence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reflections-on-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence">#</a></h3>
<p>This experiment highlights an important point: i think that with a <strong>more precise definition of assets, protection architectures, and operational dynamics</strong>, the AI could have generated a report much closer to professional standards.<br>
However, since the company is fictional, I chose <strong>not to create overly detailed artificial data</strong>, to keep the process clear and focused.</p>
<p>An alternative would have been to <strong>base the scenario on real cases</strong>, using <strong>specific technical configurations</strong>, but that would have required providing the system with much more documentation—greatly increasing complexity and reducing immediacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely that using a <strong>simpler or more structured business case</strong> would have led to a more concrete and usable AI-generated output.</p>

<p>To address the risk of <em>hallucinations</em> and unverifiable claims, I applied several mitigation strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low temperature</strong> to reduce model creativity</li>
<li><strong>Specific prompts</strong> to anchor the generation to reliable sources</li>
<li><strong>Well-calibrated RAG memory settings</strong> for normative and technical alignment</li>
<li><strong>Manual review</strong> of generated content with the source documents, thanks to the ability of Catshire to check the use of the documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result appears to have <strong>managed hallucinations well</strong>:<br>
<em>NIST CSF</em> categories and the <em>OWASP methodology</em> were applied correctly, without conceptual errors or fabricated claims. The content is <strong>consistent with the sources</strong>, credible, and free of obvious inaccuracies—though, as noted, it remains somewhat general.</p>

<h2 id="ai-agent-usage-experience--personal-reflections">AI Agent Usage Experience – <em>Personal Reflections</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ai-agent-usage-experience--personal-reflections">#</a></h2>
<p>Overall, my experience using the AI agent with RAG architecture was <strong>useful</strong>, but it also revealed a certain <strong>fragility in the system</strong>. Even small prompt errors or vague instructions were enough to disrupt the coherence of the generation, often forcing me to start over to avoid cascading issues. While this is manageable in a didactic project with a fictional company and limited scope, I <strong>wouldn’t consider it reliable for real-world, complex systems</strong>, where interactions need to be far more stable and scalable.</p>
<p>Regarding configuration, I initially used the <strong>default parameters from the lab demo</strong>, but later experimented especially with the <strong>temperature</strong>, aiming to reduce the risk of hallucinated or unverifiable content. This helped me understand the value of fine-tuning model parameters. Ultimately, I concluded that the demo&rsquo;s defaults were quite solid and caused fewer problems overall.<br>
However, I <strong>had to increase the Max Output Tokens</strong>, since the default value caused issues when generating the OWASP risk rating table.</p>
<p>When designing the fictional company, I deliberately made it <strong>more complex than the one used in the lab</strong>, in order to test the limits of using AI + RAG system for producing structured reports. Compared to the demo, I included a <strong>range of assets and security systems</strong> in the prompt because the initial outputs were too generic—so much so that the AI complained itself and asked for more detail. With this approach, I managed to strike  a consistent company structure, sufficiently detailed report and see the limitations of using this system for reporting in Cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Also, compared and in addition to the demo, i modified the prefix prompt by consistently including the original prompt, together with my added content on security systems and assets. These details were essential, as the AI tended to omit them when generating the company organization structure, which led to inconsistencies in the subsequent outputs relative to my initial prompt.</p>
<p>Throughout the session, I executed the prompts with great care (as shown in the conversation attached at the end of the file), and I uploaded official reference documents: <em>NIST CSF 2.0 Implementation Examples</em>, <em>NIST CSWP 29 – Cybersecurity Framework 2.0</em> , all sourced from their official repositories.</p>
<p>For each prompt, I ensured that the RAG system was enabled and functioning correctly, and that the outputs were consistent with both the uploaded documents and the context defined in the prompt.</p>
<p>I tasked the AI with the <strong>final part of the analysis</strong>, asking it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the generated cybersecurity report, and</li>
<li>Determine the appropriate <strong>NIST CSF Tier</strong> for the fictional company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just like in the demo, I had the same AI generate a final, clean summary report of all the work related to the NIST, that you’ve just seen [here](#Cybersecurity Assessment Report: Black Mesa Technologies) in this document. I did this because it had the full context of the previous conversations, despite the low episodic memory.</p>
<p>The finally i had the AI perform the risk assessment — this time by providing the entire company structure along with the initial prompt, and having the AI use the risk assessment document <em>OWASP Risk Rating Methodology</em>.</p>
